<s> And mass incarceration , in my judgment , has fundamentally changed our world . </s> ||| <s> theo tôi , sự phạt tù rộng rãi như thế đã cơ bản thay đổi thế giới này </s>
<s> In poor communities , in communities of color there is this despair , there is this hopelessness , that is being shaped by these outcomes . </s> ||| <s> Đối với những người nghèo , người da màu hệ luỵ của việc này đã khiến họ phải sống với nỗi thất vọng tràn trề . </s>

<s> We have a system of justice in this country that treats you much better if you &apos;re rich and guilty than if you &apos;re poor and innocent . </s> ||| <s> Chúng ta đang có một hệ thống tư pháp sẽ sẵn sàng đối xử với các bạn tốt hơn nhiều nếu bạn phạm tội nhưng giàu có so với người nghèo dù họ vô tội </s>
<s> Wealth , not <unk> , shapes outcomes . </s> ||| <s> Chính sự giàu có , chứ không phải là có tội hay không có tội ảnh hưởng đến kết quả . </s>
<s> And yet , we seem to be very comfortable . </s> ||| <s> mặc dù vậy , chúng ta dường như vẫn thấy thoải mái về điều này </s>
<s> The politics of fear and anger have made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems . </s> ||| <s> Nỗi sợ hãi lẫn và giận dữ chính trị đã khiến chúng ta tin rằng đây không phải và vấn đề mà chúng ta phải lo </s>
<s> We &apos;ve been disconnected . </s> ||| <s> thế là chúng ta tách biệt </s>

<s> I represent people on death row . </s> ||| <s> Tôi xin lên tiếng làm đại diện cho những người tử tù </s>
<s> It &apos;s interesting , this question of the death penalty . </s> ||| <s> câu hỏi về án tử hình được đặt ra này rất thú vị . </s>
<s> In many ways , we &apos;ve been taught to think that the real question is , do people deserve to die for the crimes they &apos;ve committed ? </s> ||| <s> Bằng nhiều cách , chúng ta được dạy để tin rằng câu hỏi thực sự là liệu người ta có đáng phải chết vì tội lỗi mà họ đã gây ra ? </s>
<s> And that &apos;s a very sensible question . </s> ||| <s> Đây là một câu hỏi rất hợp lý </s>
<s> But there &apos;s another way of thinking about where we are in our identity . </s> ||| <s> nhưng vẫn có cách nghĩ khác về chúng ta đang ở đâu trong nhân cách của mình . </s>
<s> The other way of thinking about it is not , do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit , but do we deserve to kill ? </s> ||| <s> Cách nghĩ khác về điều này không phải là liệu người có tội có đáng chết hay không mà liệu chúng ta có quyền giết họ hay không ? </s>
<s> I mean , it &apos;s fascinating . </s> ||| <s> ý tôi là , thật khó tin ! </s>
<s> Death penalty in America is defined by error . </s> ||| <s> Án tử hình tại Mỹ được xác định một cách không chính xác </s>

<s> We have a hard time talking about race , and I believe it &apos;s because we are <unk> to commit ourselves to a process of truth and reconciliation . </s> ||| <s> chúng ta đã khó khăn lắm khi nói về vấn đề chủng tộc tôi tin chắc đó là vì chúng ta không sẵn sàng thừa nhận chân lý và hoà giải </s>
<s> In South Africa , people understood that we couldn &apos;t overcome apartheid without a commitment to truth and reconciliation . </s> ||| <s> Ở Nam phi , người ta biết rằng họ không thể chống chọi với chế độ <unk> nếu họ không cam kết với sự thật và làm hoà </s>

<s> And I actually believe that the TED community needs to be more courageous . </s> ||| <s> Tôi thực sự cho rằng cộng đồng TED cần phải dũng cảm hơn . </s>
<s> We need to find ways to embrace these challenges , these problems , the suffering . </s> ||| <s> Chúng ta cần tìm cách để đối đầu với những thách thức , những vấn đề và cả nỗi khổ mà sự bất công gây ra </s>
<s> Because ultimately , our humanity depends on everyone &apos;s humanity . </s> ||| <s> Bởi vì xét cho cùng , tất cả chúng ta phụ thuộc từng cá nhân sống trên hành tinh này . </s>
<s> I &apos;ve learned very simple things doing the work that I do . </s> ||| <s> Tôi đã học được những điều rất đơn giản khi làm công việc của mình . </s>
<s> It &apos;s just taught me very simple things . </s> ||| <s> Nó chỉ dạy tôi những điều rất đơn giản . </s>
<s> I &apos;ve come to understand and to believe that each of us is more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done . </s> ||| <s> Và tôi dần hiểu và tin rằng mỗi chúng ta phải hơn điều tệ nhất mà chúng ta từng làm . </s>
<s> I believe that for every person on the planet . </s> ||| <s> Tôi tin điều đó đúng với mọi người trên trái đất này . </s>
<s> I think if somebody tells a lie , they &apos;re not just a liar . </s> ||| <s> Tôi cho rằng nếu ai đó nói dối , họ không đơn thuần là kẻ dối trá . </s>
<s> I think if somebody takes something that doesn &apos;t belong to them , they &apos;re not just a <unk> . </s> ||| <s> nếu ai lấy một món đồ gì mà không thuộc quyền sở hữu của họ , họ không chỉ là một tên trộm . </s>
<s> I think even if you kill someone , you &apos;re not just a killer . </s> ||| <s> Tôi cho rằng , thâm chí khi bạn giết ai đó , bạn cũng không hẳn là một kẻ sát nhân . </s>
<s> And because of that there &apos;s this basic human dignity that must be respected by law . </s> ||| <s> và vì thế , con người chúng ta có phẩm giá cơ bản phải được luật pháp bảo vệ . </s>

<s> I actually think , in too many places , the opposite of poverty is justice . </s> ||| <s> Tôi thực sự nghĩ rằng ở rất nhiều nơi đối nghịch với cái nghèo là sự công bằng </s>
<s> And finally , I believe that , despite the fact that it is so dramatic and so beautiful and so inspiring and so stimulating , we will ultimately not be judged by our technology , we won &apos;t be judged by our design , we won &apos;t be judged by our intellect and reason . </s> ||| <s> và cuối cùng , tôi tin rằng dù sự thật là điều này rất ly kỳ rất tuyệt , rất hứng thú và rất kích thích nhưng chúng ta cuối cùng sẽ chẳng bị phán xét bởi công nghệ chúng ta làm ra bởi thiết kế của mình , bởi trí tuệ và lý tưởng </s>
<s> Ultimately , you judge the character of a society , not by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the privileged , but by how they treat the poor , the condemned , the incarcerated . </s> ||| <s> và bạn không nhận xét một xã hội bằng cách họ đối xử với người giàu , người có quyền lực và người được đặc quyền đăc lợi mà thông qua cách họ đối xử với người nghèo , người có tội hay tù nhân . </s>
<s> Because it &apos;s in that <unk> that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are . </s> ||| <s> Bởi vì đó là hệ quả của việc chúng ta bắt đầu có cái nhìn sâu sắc về chúng ta là ai . </s>

<s> Other than writing a check , what could we do ? </s> ||| <s> Thay vì chỉ biết quyên góp tiền , chúng tôi có thể giúp được gì ? </s>
<s> Well there are opportunities all around us . </s> ||| <s> À , Luôn có nhiều cơ hội xung quanh chúng ta . </s>
<s> If you live in the state of California , for example , there &apos;s a referendum coming up this spring where actually there &apos;s going to be an effort to <unk> some of the money we spend on the politics of punishment . </s> ||| <s> Ví dụ , nếu bạn sống ở ban California , thì mùa xuân này sẽ có một cuộc trưng cầu dân ý tại đây , chúng tôi đang nỗ lực tái định hướng một phần tiền sử dụng vào các hình phạt . </s>
<s> For example , here in California we &apos;re going to spend one billion dollars on the death penalty in the next five years -- one billion dollars . </s> ||| <s> Ví dụ tại <unk> Chúng tôi sẽ chi 1 triệu đô la cho án phạt tử hình trong 5 năm tới . Vâng , 1 triệu đô la . </s>
<s> And yet , 46 percent of all <unk> cases don &apos;t result in arrest . </s> ||| <s> Và 46 % vụ án giết người không bị bắt . </s>
<s> 56 percent of all rape cases don &apos;t result . </s> ||| <s> 56 % vụ án hiếp dâm không được xử lý . </s>
<s> So there &apos;s an opportunity to change that . </s> ||| <s> Vì thế , chúng ta có một cơ hội để thay đổi tình hình này . </s>
<s> And this referendum would propose having those dollars go to law enforcement and safety . </s> ||| <s> và đợt trưng cầu dân ý này sẽ đưa ra kiến nghị để có tiền để thi hành và đảm bảo tính công bằng của luật pháp . </s>
<s> And I think that opportunity exists all around us . </s> ||| <s> Và tôi nghĩ rằng cơ hội luôn ở quanh chúng ta . </s>
<s> There &apos;s been this huge decline in crime in America over the last three decades . </s> ||| <s> Tội phạm ở Mỹ đã giảm đi rất nhiều suốt 3 thập niên qua . </s>
<s> And part of the narrative of that is sometimes that it &apos;s about increased incarceration rates . </s> ||| <s> Và một phần của câu chuyện đó là đôi khi là do tăng thời gian giam giữ . </s>
<s> What would you say to someone who believed that ? </s> ||| <s> Bạn sẽ nói gì với những ai tin vào chuyện này ? </s>
<s> Well actually the violent crime rate has remained relatively stable . </s> ||| <s> Thực chất là tỉ lệ phạm tội bạo lực vẫn ở mức tương đối ổn định . </s>
<s> The great increase in mass incarceration in this country wasn &apos;t really in violent crime categories . </s> ||| <s> Tỉ lệ bị bắt giam ở nước Mỹ tăng mạnh thực ra không phải tội phạm bạo lực . </s>
<s> It was this <unk> war on drugs . </s> ||| <s> Mà đây chính là một cuộc chiến chống lại ma tuý . </s>
<s> That &apos;s where the dramatic increases have come in our prison population . </s> ||| <s> và số lượng người bị bắt giam đã tăng lên rất đáng kể . </s>
<s> And we got carried away with the rhetoric of punishment . </s> ||| <s> Và chúng ta đã mất đi sự kiểm soát đối với mặt trái của các hình phạt . </s>
<s> And so we have three strikes laws that put people in prison forever for stealing a bicycle , for low-level property crimes , rather than making them give those resources back to the people who they <unk> . </s> ||| <s> và vì thế , chúng ta có 3 cuộc chiến chống lại việc người ta bị tù chung thân chỉ vì ăn trộm xe đạp hay trộm cấp tài sản mức độ nhẹ thay vì buộc họ trả lại những gì mà họ lấy cho chủ nhân của tài sản đó . </s>
<s> I believe we need to do more to help people who are <unk> by crime , not do less . </s> ||| <s> Tôi tin rằng chúng ta cần làm nhiều việc hơn nữa để giúp đỡ những người bị biến thành nạn nhân bởi tội ác chứ không phải là làm ít đi . </s>
<s> And I think our current punishment philosophy does nothing for no one . </s> ||| <s> Tôi nghĩ triết lý hình phạt hiện tại của chúng ta thật vô ích , chẳng giúp được gì cho ai cả . </s>
<s> And I think that &apos;s the orientation that we have to change . </s> ||| <s> Tôi cho rằng đó là điều mà chúng ta cần phải thay đổi . </s>

<s> I &apos;m going to speak about a tiny , little idea . </s> ||| <s> Tôi sẽ nói về một ý tưởng nho nhỏ </s>
<s> And this is about shifting baseline . </s> ||| <s> về sự dịch chuyển của đường mốc giới </s>
<s> And because the idea can be explained in one minute , I will tell you three stories before to fill in the time . </s> ||| <s> Và vì ý tưởng đó có thể được giải thích trong vòng 1 phút . Tôi sẽ kể cho các bạn 3 câu chuyện trước để lấp vào thời gian còn thừa . </s>
<s> And the first story is about Charles Darwin , one of my heroes . </s> ||| <s> Câu chuyện thứ nhất là về Charles Darwin , một trong những vị anh hùng của tôi </s>
<s> And he was here , as you well know , in &apos; 35 . </s> ||| <s> Ông đã đến đây trong những năm <unk> như các bạn biết khá rõ </s>
<s> And you &apos;d think he was chasing <unk> , but he wasn &apos;t . </s> ||| <s> Và bạn nghĩ rằng Ông đến để đuổi bắt <unk> Núi , nhưng không phải thế . </s>
<s> He was actually collecting fish . </s> ||| <s> Thực ra Ông thu thập các loại cá . </s>
<s> And he described one of them as very &quot; common . &quot; </s> ||| <s> Ông miêu tả một trong số chúng là rất &quot; Thông thường &quot; </s>
<s> This was the <unk> <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Đây là con cá <unk> vây buồm . </s>
<s> A big fishery was run on it until the &apos; 80s . </s> ||| <s> Một ngành ngư nghiệp quy mô lớn đang khai thác loại cá này cho đến thập niên 80 . </s>
<s> Now the fish is on the <unk> Red List . </s> ||| <s> Hiện tại loại cá này đang nằm trong Danh Sách Đỏ của <unk> . </s>
<s> Now this story , we have heard it lots of times on Galapagos and other places , so there is nothing particular about it . </s> ||| <s> Câu chuyện này. chúng ta đã nghe rất nhiều lần về Galapagos và những nơi khác. vậy nên chẳng có gì đặc biệt về nó hết . </s>
<s> But the point is , we still come to Galapagos . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng điểm chính là , chúng ta vẫn đến Galapagos . </s>
<s> We still think it is pristine . </s> ||| <s> Chúng ta vẫn nghĩ nó còn nguyên sơ </s>
<s> The <unk> still say it is untouched . </s> ||| <s> Những tờ rơi quảng cáo vẫn đang thông tin rằng chúng chưa bị chạm đến </s>
<s> So what happens here ? </s> ||| <s> Vậy thì điều gì xảy ra tại đây ? </s>
<s> The second story , also to illustrate another concept , is called shifting <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Câu chuyện thứ hai , vẫn là để chú giải cho một khái niệm khác cái được gọi là sự dịch chuyển của đường hông . </s>
<s> Because I was there in &apos; 71 , studying a <unk> in West Africa . </s> ||| <s> Cười Tôi đã đến đó vào năm <unk> , nghiên cứu đầm phá ở Tây Phi </s>
<s> I was there because I grew up in Europe and I wanted later to work in Africa . </s> ||| <s> Tôi đến đó vì <unk> đã lớn lên ở Châu Âu và đã mong muốn rằng sau này sẽ được làm việc tại Châu Phi </s>
<s> And I thought I could blend in . </s> ||| <s> Mặc dù tôi đã có thể hoà nhập với cuộc sống tại đó </s>
<s> And I got a big <unk> , and I was convinced that I was really not from there . </s> ||| <s> Tôi có làn da rám nắng <unk> đã bị thuyết phục là mình thực sự không đến từ đó </s>
<s> This was my first <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Đây là vết rám nắng đầu tiên của tôi </s>
<s> And the <unk> was surrounded by palm trees , as you can see , and a few mangrove . </s> ||| <s> <unk> phá được bao quanh bởi cây cọ bạn có thể thấy , một vài cây đước . </s>
<s> And it had <unk> about 20 centimeters , a species of <unk> called <unk> <unk> . </s> ||| <s> có cả cá rô phi khoảng chừng 20 cm một loài cá rô phi được với với cái tên là cá rô phi cằm đen </s>
<s> And the fisheries for this <unk> sustained lots of fish and they had a good time and they earned more than average in Ghana . </s> ||| <s> Ngành thuỷ sản đánh bắt cá rô phi cằm đen này giúp ổn định số lượng cá và họ thực sự có thời đánh bắt khá thuận lợi họ kiếm được nhiều hơn mức thu nhập trung bình ở Ghana . </s>
<s> When I went there 27 years later , the fish had shrunk to half of their size . </s> ||| <s> 27 năm sau khi tôi trở lại , kích cỡ của loại cá này chỉ còn phân nửa . </s>
<s> They were <unk> at five centimeters . </s> ||| <s> Chúng đạt đến độ tuổi trưởng thành tại kích cỡ <unk> </s>
<s> They had been pushed genetically . </s> ||| <s> Đã có một sự tác động về gen lên trên loại cá này </s>
<s> There were still <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Còn có rất nhiều cá </s>
<s> They were still kind of happy . </s> ||| <s> chúng vẫn rất yên ổn . </s>
<s> And the fish also were happy to be there . </s> ||| <s> Và những loại cá này dường như cũng thoải mái khi ở đó . </s>
<s> So nothing has changed , but everything has changed . </s> ||| <s> Thế nên chẳng có gì thay đổi cả , nhưng mọi thứ đã biến đổi . </s>
<s> My third little story is that I was an <unk> in the introduction of <unk> in Southeast Asia . </s> ||| <s> Câu chuyện nho nhỏ thứ 3 của Tôi đó là khi tôi đang là người đồng thực hiện đưa vào giới thiệu phương thức đánh cá kéo lưới từ đuôi thuyền tại Đông Nam Á </s>
<s> In the &apos; 70s -- well , beginning in the &apos; 60s -- Europe did lots of development projects . </s> ||| <s> trong những năm <unk> , à không , bắt đầu từ những năm <unk> Châu Âu thực hiện rất nhiều các dự án phát triển </s>
<s> Fish development meant imposing on countries that had already 100,000 <unk> to impose on them industrial fishing . </s> ||| <s> Phát triển ngành đánh bắt cá điều đó có nghĩa là áp đặt lên những quốc gia đó những nước mà đã có 100,000 ngư dân áp đặt ngành công <unk> đánh bắt cá lên họ </s>
<s> And this boat , quite ugly , is called the <unk> 4 . </s> ||| <s> Và cái thuyền này đây , khá xấu , được gọi là <unk> 4 . </s>
<s> And I went sailing on it , and we did surveys throughout the southern South China sea and especially the Java Sea . </s> ||| <s> Tôi dùng nó để làm các cuộc khảo sát xuyên suốt vùng phía Nam của biển Nam Hải Trung Quốc và đặc biệt vùng biển Java . </s>
<s> And what we caught , we didn &apos;t have words for it . </s> ||| <s> Cái mà chúng tôi bắt được , chúng tôi không tìm được từ giải nghĩa cho nó </s>
<s> What we caught , I know now , is the bottom of the sea . </s> ||| <s> cái mà chúng tôi bắt được , hiện tại tôi đã biết được rằng đó là đáy biển </s>
<s> And 90 percent of our catch were <unk> , other animals that are fixed on the bottom . </s> ||| <s> 90 % cái mà chúng tôi đánh bắt được là bọt biển , và những sinh vật khác sống chặt dưới đáy biển </s>
<s> And actually most of the fish , they are a little spot on the debris , the piles of debris , were coral reef fish . </s> ||| <s> Và thực tế hầu hết các loại cá những loại rất nhỏ như những vết chấm trong đám mảnh vụn , hay những <unk> vụn , là những con cá sống ở rặng san hô </s>
<s> Essentially the bottom of the sea came onto the deck and then was thrown down . </s> ||| <s> Điều chính yếu là những thứ dưới đáy biển được kéo lên thuyền sau đó lại bị vứt ngược trở lại . </s>
<s> And these pictures are extraordinary because this transition is very rapid . </s> ||| <s> Những tấm hình này thật quá sứ tưởng tượng vì sự chuyển dịch này diễn ra quá nhanh chóng </s>
<s> Within a year , you do a survey and then commercial fishing begins . </s> ||| <s> Trong vòng 1 năm , bạn làm một cuộc khảo sát sau đó ngành đánh bắt cá thương mại bắt đầu . </s>

<s> So when I was a graduate student at Stanford University , I used to go to this very , very <unk> grocery store ; at least at that time it was truly <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Khi tôi là sinh viên tốt nghiệp từ đại học Stanford , tôi đã từng vào rất nhiều cửa hàng tạp hoá mắc tiền , lúc đó , tôi thật sự khá giàu , </s>
<s> It was a store called <unk> &apos;s . </s> ||| <s> Đây là cửa hàng với tên <unk> &apos; <unk> </s>
<s> Now this store , it was almost like going to an amusement park . </s> ||| <s> Bây giờ , nó gần như trở thành công viên giải trí . </s>
<s> They had 250 different kinds of <unk> and <unk> and over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of bottled water -- and this was during a time when we actually used to drink tap water . </s> ||| <s> Họ có 250 loại giấm và mù tạc khác nhau và hơn 500 loại trái cây và rau <unk> khác nhau và hơn 2 tá loại nước khác nhau và đó là thời gian chúng tôi thực sự thường uống nước máy .. </s>
<s> I used to love going to this store , but on one occasion I asked myself , well how come you never buy anything ? </s> ||| <s> Tôi đã từng rất thích vào cửa hàng này , nhưng tự nhiên , tôi đã từng tự hỏi mình Làm sao bạn đến và không mua thứ gì ? </s>
<s> Here &apos;s their olive oil aisle . </s> ||| <s> Đây là gian hàng dầu <unk> của họ . </s>
<s> They had over 75 different kinds of olive oil , including those that were in a locked case that came from <unk> olive trees . </s> ||| <s> Họ có hơn 75 loại dầu <unk> khác nhau , bao gồm cả những loại trong tủ khoá do chúng làm từ những cây <unk> hàng trăm tuổi </s>
<s> So I one day decided to pay a visit to the manager , and I asked the manager , &quot; Is this model of offering people all this choice really working ? &quot; </s> ||| <s> Cho nên , 1 ngày , tôi quyết định lại chỗ người quản lý , và tôi hỏi , &quot; Cái cách mời gọi mọi người những lựa chọn này có thực sự hiệu quả ? &quot; </s>
<s> And he pointed to the <unk> of <unk> that would show up everyday , with cameras ready usually . </s> ||| <s> Và anh ta chỉ và đám đông khách du lịch thường xuyên vào mỗi ngày , được máy camera quay lại thường <unk> , </s>
<s> We decided to do a little experiment , and we picked jam for our experiment . </s> ||| <s> Chúng tôi đã quyết định thực hiện 1 thí nghiệm nhỏ , và chúng tôi đã lấy <unk> cho cuộc thí nghiệm . </s>
<s> Here &apos;s their jam aisle . </s> ||| <s> Đây là gian hàng bán <unk> của họ </s>
<s> They had <unk> different kinds of jam . </s> ||| <s> Họ có hơn <unk> loại <unk> khác nhau . </s>
<s> We set up a little <unk> booth right near the entrance of the store . </s> ||| <s> Chúng tôi đã mở 1 quầy nếm thử nhỏ ngay gần cửa vào cửa hàng . </s>
<s> We there put out six different flavors of jam or 24 different flavors of jam , and we looked at two things : First , in which case were people more likely to stop , sample some jam ? </s> ||| <s> Chúng tôi đã đem ra 6 loại <unk> mùi khác nhau hay 24 loại <unk> mùi khác nhau , Và chúng tôi nhận ra 2 điều : Điều thứ nhất , trong trường hợp nào mọi người muốn dừng lại , nếm thử vài loại <unk> ? </s>
<s> More people stopped when there were 24 , about 60 percent , than when there were six , about 40 percent . </s> ||| <s> Nhiều người đã dừng lại , khoảng 60 % khi chúng tôi đưa ra 24 loại <unk> , Và khi chỉ có 6 loại , thì chỉ có 40 % . </s>
<s> The next thing we looked at is in which case were people more likely to buy a jar of jam . </s> ||| <s> Điều tiếp theo , chúng tôi nhận ra Trong trường hợp nào mọi người thích mua 1 chai <unk> . </s>
<s> Now we see the opposite effect . </s> ||| <s> Bây giờ chúng ta thấy hiệu ứng ngược lại . </s>
<s> Of the people who stopped when there were 24 , only three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam . </s> ||| <s> Trong số những người dừng lại khi chúng tôi đưa ra 24 loại , Chỉ có 3 % trong số họ mua 1 chai <unk> . </s>
<s> Of the people who stopped when there were six , well now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a jar of jam . </s> ||| <s> Còn trong số những người dừng lại khi chỉ có 6 loại <unk> , Bất ngờ khi chúng tôi thấy tới 30 % trong số đó mua 1 chai <unk> . </s>
<s> Now if you do the math , people were at least six times more likely to buy a jar of jam if they encountered six than if they encountered 24 . </s> ||| <s> Bây giờ , thử làm 1 bài toán ít nhất gấp 6 lần số người muốn mua 1 chai <unk> khi họ thấy 6 loại hơn là khi họ thấy 24 loại . </s>
<s> Now choosing not to buy a jar of jam is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our <unk> -- but it turns out that this choice overload problem affects us even in very consequential decisions . </s> ||| <s> Bây giờ không bàn về lựa chọn mua chai <unk> có lẽ tốt hơn cho chúng ta ít nhất là sẽ tốt hơn cho vòng eo chúng ta Ví dụ trên đã chỉ ra rằng vấn đề quá tải trong sự lựa chọn ảnh hưởng chúng ta trong mỗi quyết định quan trọng </s>
<s> We choose not to choose , even when it goes against our best <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Chúng ta chọn không chọn gì cả thậm chí khi điều đó đi ngược lại với những điều chỉ tốt cho chúng ta . </s>
<s> So now for the topic of today : financial savings . </s> ||| <s> Chủ đề hôm nay sẽ tiếp tục với : Tiết kiệm tài chính </s>
<s> Now I &apos;m going to describe to you a study I did with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> where we looked at the retirement savings decisions of nearly a million Americans from about 650 plans all in the U.S. </s> ||| <s> Bây giờ , tôi sẽ kể cho bạn 1 bài học tôi đã có với <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> nơi chúng ta nhìn vào những quyết định tiết kiệm tiền hưu trí của gần 1 triệu người mỹ từ khoảng 650 kế hoạch ở mỹ . </s>
<s> And what we looked at was whether the number of fund <unk> available in a retirement savings plan , the 401 plan , does that affect people &apos;s likelihood to save more for tomorrow . </s> ||| <s> Và điều chúng ta thấy được là liệu số lượng nguồn tài trợ có sẵn trong kế hoạch tiết kiệm hưu trí kê hoạch số 401 có ảnh hưởng tới khả năng có thể để tiết kiệm hơn cho ngày mai </s>
<s> And what we found was that indeed there was a correlation . </s> ||| <s> Và điều chúng tôi phát hiện ra là trong đó tồn tại một sự tương quan </s>
<s> So in these plans , we had about <unk> plans that <unk> from offering people anywhere from two to 59 different fund <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Cho nên trong những kế hoạch đó , chúng tôi đã có <unk> kế hoạch được trải dài từ những người tình nguyện ở mọi nơi từ 59 nguồn tại trợ khác nhau </s>
<s> And what we found was that , the more funds offered , indeed , there was less participation rate . </s> ||| <s> Và chúng tôi phát hiện rằng Càng nhiều nguồn được đưa ra thì thật sự , tỉ lệ tham gia càng ít </s>
<s> So if you look at the extremes , those plans that offered you two funds , participation rates were around in the <unk> -- still not as high as we want it to be . </s> ||| <s> Cho nên nếu bạn nhìn kĩ hơn nữa những kế hoạch mà tài trợ cho bạn 2 nguồn tài chính tỉ <unk> tham gia vào khoảng giữa những năm 70 vẫn không cao như chúng tôi <unk> </s>
<s> In those plans that offered nearly 60 funds , participation rates have now dropped to about the <unk> <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Trong những kế hoạch tài trợ gần 60 nguồn tài chính tỉ lệ tham gia hiện tại đã giảm khoảng 1 trong những 60 nguồn đó . </s>
<s> Now it turns out that even if you do choose to participate when there are more choices present , even then , it has negative consequences . </s> ||| <s> Bây giờ , nó chỉ ra rằng thậm chí bạn có chọn tham gia khi có nhiều hơn sự lựa chọn hiện tại thậm chí , có có những hậu quả tiêu cực </s>
<s> So for those people who did choose to participate , the more choices available , the more likely people were to completely avoid stocks or equity funds . </s> ||| <s> Đối với những ai đã lựa chọn tham gia Càng nhiều sự lựa chọn hơn nữa thì càng nhiều người tham gia để tránh sự tồn kho . </s>
<s> The more choices available , the more likely they were to put all their money in pure money market accounts . </s> ||| <s> Càng nhiều sự lựa chọn Càng nhiều người gửi tất cả tiền của họ vào những tài khoản thị trường tài chính </s>
<s> Now neither of these extreme decisions are the kinds of decisions that any of us would recommend for people when you &apos;re considering their future financial well-being . </s> ||| <s> Bây giờ không phải là những sự lụa chọn đó là những sự lựa chọn mà bất cứ ai trong chúng ta cũng khuyên cho mọi người khi bạn xem xét sự khả thi tài chính cho họ </s>
<s> Well , over the past decade , we have observed three main negative consequences to offering people more and more choices . </s> ||| <s> Hơn 1 thập kỉ trong quá khứ Chúng ta đã chứng kiến 3 hậu quả tiêu cực chính khi đưa ra cho mọi người nhiều sự lựa chọn </s>
<s> They &apos;re more likely to delay choosing -- <unk> even when it goes against their best self-interest . </s> ||| <s> họ thích trì hoãn sự lựa chọn Sự trì hoãn thậm trí khi nó đi ngược lại lợi ích tốt nhất cho bản thân họ . </s>
<s> They &apos;re more likely to make worse choices -- worse financial choices , medical choices . </s> ||| <s> Họ dường như đưa ra những sự lựa chọn tệ hơn tệ hơn trong tài chính , y tế . </s>
<s> They &apos;re more likely to choose things that make them less satisfied , even when they do objectively better . </s> ||| <s> Họ dường như chọn những điều làm họ ít hài lòng hơn khi họ có khả năng làm tốt hơn </s>
<s> The main reason for this is because , we might enjoy <unk> at those giant walls of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , jams , but we can &apos;t actually do the math of comparing and <unk> and actually picking from that stunning display . </s> ||| <s> Lý do chính ở đây là bởi gì chúng ta có thể yêu thích nhìn vào những bức tường to lớn của sốt <unk> , mù tạc , giấm , <unk> nhưng chúng ta không thể thực hiện bài toán của sự so sách và sự tương phản và thậm chí từ sự cho thấy ngạc nhiên </s>
<s> So what I want to propose to you today are four simple techniques -- techniques that we have tested in one way or another in different research venues -- that you can easily apply in your businesses . </s> ||| <s> cho nên điều tôi muốn đề nghị bạn hôm nay là 4 kĩ thuật đơn giản Những kĩ thuật mà chúng tôi đã kiểm tra bằng nhiều cách trong nhiều bản khảo sát mà bạn có thể áp dụng dễ dàng trong kinh doanh của bạn </s>

<s> You &apos;ve heard it said before , but it &apos;s never been more true than today , that less is more . </s> ||| <s> Bản đã nghe điều đó trước đây nhưng điều đó không đúng so với hiện nay mà ít hơn thì nhiều hơn </s>
<s> People are always upset when I say , &quot; Cut . &quot; </s> ||| <s> Mọi người luôn luôn lúng túng khi tôi nói , &quot; cắt giảm &quot; </s>
<s> They &apos;re always worried they &apos;re going to lose shelf space . </s> ||| <s> Họ luôn lo lắng họ sẽ sắp sửa mất vị trí của họ </s>
<s> But in fact , what we &apos;re seeing more and more is that if you are willing to cut , get rid of those <unk> redundant options , well there &apos;s an increase in sales , there &apos;s a lowering of costs , there is an improvement of the choosing experience . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng thực tế , điều chúng ta càng ngày thấy được là nếu bạn sẵn sàng cắt giảm loại bỏ nhiều lựa chọn ngoài luồng Tồn tại sự gia tăng doanh thu bán hàng giảm xuống các chi phí , Và đó là sự cải thiện trong kinh nghiệm lựa chọn </s>
<s> When <unk> &amp; amp ; Gamble went from 26 different kinds of Head &amp; amp ; <unk> to 15 , they saw an increase in sales by 10 percent . </s> ||| <s> Khi <unk> &amp; amp ; Gamble giảm từ 26 loại <unk> &amp; amp ; <unk> xuống 15 Họ nhận thấy sự gia tăng doanh số bán hàng lên 10 % </s>
<s> When the Golden Cat Corporation got rid of their 10 <unk> cat litter products , they saw an increase in profits by <unk> percent -- a function of both increase in sales and lowering of costs . </s> ||| <s> Khi tập đoàn <unk> <unk> loại bỏ 10 sản phẩm bán tệ nhất dành cho mèo Họ nhận thấy sự gia tăng trong lợi nhuận lên <unk> % 1 hàm của sự gia tăng lợi nhuận và sự cắt giảm chi phí </s>
<s> You know , the average grocery store today offers you 45,000 products . </s> ||| <s> Bạn biết đó , trung bình các cửa hàng tạp hoá ngày nay đưa ra cho bạn <unk> sản phẩm </s>
<s> The typical Walmart today offers you 100,000 products . </s> ||| <s> Walmart thời nay đưa cho bạn tới 100.000 sản phẩm </s>
<s> But the ninth largest <unk> , the ninth biggest <unk> in the world today is <unk> , and it offers you only <unk> products -- one kind of canned tomato sauce . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng cửa <unk> bán lẻ lớn thứ 9 cửa hàng bán lẻ đứng thứ 9 trên thế giới hiện nay là <unk> Và nó chỉ đưa ra 1400 sản phẩm 1 loại sốt cà được đóng hộp </s>
<s> Now in the financial savings world , I think one of the best examples that has recently come out on how to best manage the choice <unk> has actually been something that David <unk> was heavily involved in designing , which was the program that they have at Harvard . </s> ||| <s> Bây giờ trong thế giới tiết kiệm tài chính , Tôi nghĩ rằng 1 trong những ví dụ tốt nhất để làm sao đưa ra những sự lựa chọn tốt nhất đó là việc David <unk> liên quan đến việc thiết kế Đó là chương trình ở Harvard </s>
<s> Every single Harvard employee is now automatically enrolled in a <unk> fund . </s> ||| <s> Mỗi người làm công ở <unk> được đăng kí tự động trong 1 nguồn . </s>
<s> For those people who actually want to choose , they &apos;re given 20 funds , not 300 or more funds . </s> ||| <s> Đối với những ai thực sự muốn chọn Họ đưa ra 20 nguồn tài chính không phải 300 hay hơn đó . </s>
<s> You know , often , people say , &quot; I don &apos;t know how to cut . </s> ||| <s> Người ta thường nói &quot; Tôi không biết làm sao để cắt giảm &quot; </s>
<s> They &apos;re all important choices . &quot; </s> ||| <s> Tất cả đều là sự lựa chọn quan trọng </s>
<s> And the first thing I do is I ask the employees , &quot; Tell me how these choices are different from one another . </s> ||| <s> Và điều đầu tiên tôi làm là yêu cầu những người đó &quot; Nói cho tôi biết những sự lựa chọn khác nhau như thế nào . </s>
<s> And if your employees can &apos;t tell them apart , neither can your consumers . &quot; </s> ||| <s> Và nếu người làm công của bạn không thể phân <unk> thì người tiêu dùng của bạn cũng vậy . </s>

<s> Which brings me to the second technique for handling the choice overload problem , which is <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Điều đó <unk> cho tôi kĩ thuật thứ hai trong việc giải quyết vấn đề quá tải lựa chọn mà rất cụ thể </s>
<s> That in order for people to understand the differences between the choices , they have to be able to understand the consequences associated with each choice , and that the consequences need to be felt in a vivid sort of way , in a very concrete way . </s> ||| <s> Rằng để cho mọi người hiểu sự khác nhau giữa các sự lựa chọn Họ phải có khả năng hiểu ra kết quả tương ứng với mỗi sự lựa chọn và những kết quả đó cần được cảm thấy thật rõ ràng , thật sâu sắc </s>
<s> Why do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more when they use an ATM card or a credit card as opposed to cash ? </s> ||| <s> Tại sao mọi người sử dụng trung bình 15 đến 30 % khi họ sử dụng thẻ ATM hay thẻ tín dụng so với tiền mặt ? </s>
<s> Because it doesn &apos;t feel like real money . </s> ||| <s> Bởi vì nó không giống như tiền thật </s>
<s> And it turns out that making it feel more concrete can actually be a very positive tool to use in getting people to save more . </s> ||| <s> Và điều đó chỉ ra rằng làm nó càng rõ ràng , cụ thể thì càng trở thành 1 công cụ hiệu quả để giúp mọi người tiết kiệm hơn </s>
<s> So a study that I did with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , we did a study with people at <unk> -- employees that are all working at <unk> -- and now these people were all in a session where they &apos;re doing <unk> for their 401 plan . </s> ||| <s> Cho nên bài học tôi đã làm với <unk> <unk> và <unk> <unk> Chúng tôi đã làm 1 bài với mọi người ở <unk> Những nhân viên mà làm việc tại <unk> và giờ đây những người đó đã trong 1 giai đoạn họ có thể tuyển sinh cho kế hoạch 401 </s>
<s> And during that session , we kept the session exactly the way it used to be , but we added one little thing . </s> ||| <s> Và trong suốt giai đoạn này chúng tôi giữ lại giai đoạn trước đây nhưng chỉ thêm 1 điều nhỏ </s>
<s> The one little thing we added was we asked people to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life if you saved more . </s> ||| <s> Điều nhỏ chúng tôi thêm vào đó là chúng tôi yêu cầu mọi người chỉ nghĩa về những điều tích cực sẽ xảy ra trong tương lai của họ nếu họ tiết kiệm hơn nữa </s>
<s> By doing that simple thing , there was an increase in <unk> by 20 percent and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save or the amount that they were willing to put down into their savings account by four percent . </s> ||| <s> Bằng cách làm đơn giản đó lượng đăng ký tham gia tăng đến 20 % và càng nhiều người sẵn sàng tiết kiệm hay lượng tiền họ sẵn sàng tiết kiệm tăng đến 40 % </s>
<s> The third technique : <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Kĩ thuật thứ 3 : Sự phân loại </s>
<s> We can handle more categories than we can handle choices . </s> ||| <s> Chúng ta có thể giải quyết nhiều sự phân loại hơn là chúng ta giải quyết những sự lựa chọn </s>
<s> So for example , here &apos;s a study we did in a magazine aisle . </s> ||| <s> Ví dụ , Đây là 1 buổi chúng tôi đã làm ở gian hàng tạp chí </s>
<s> It turns out that in <unk> grocery stores up and down the northeast corridor , the magazine <unk> range anywhere from <unk> different kinds of magazines all the way up to <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Nó chỉ ra rằng Những tiệm tạp hoá <unk> trên và dưới hành lang phía đông bắc gian hàng tạp chí ở mọi nơi từ <unk> các loại tạp chí khác nhau đến <unk> <unk> </s>
<s> But you know what ? </s> ||| <s> nhưng bạn biết điều gì không ? </s>
<s> If I show you 600 magazines and I divide them up into 10 categories , versus I show you 400 magazines and divide them up into 20 categories , you believe that I have given you more choice and a better choosing experience if I gave you the 400 than if I gave you the 600 . </s> ||| <s> Nếu tôi chỉ ra cho bạn 600 loại tạp chí Và tôi chia nó ra làm 10 loại so với khi tôi chỉ cho bạn 400 tạp chí và chia nó ra thành 20 loại Bạn tin rằng tôi đã đưa cho bạn nhiều sự lựa chọn và những trải nghiệm lựa chọn tốt hơn nếu tôi cho bạn 400 hơn là tôi chỉ cho bạn 600 </s>
<s> Because the categories tell me how to tell them apart . </s> ||| <s> Bởi vì sự phân chia cho tôi biết làm sao phân chia chúng </s>
<s> Here are two different jewelry displays . </s> ||| <s> bây giờ là 2 loại nữ trang khác nhau </s>
<s> One is called &quot; <unk> &quot; and the other one is called &quot; <unk> . &quot; </s> ||| <s> Một thứ được gọi là &quot; Jazz &quot; còn cái kia được gọi là &quot; <unk> &quot; </s>
<s> If you think the display on the left is <unk> and the display on the right is <unk> , clap your hands . </s> ||| <s> Nếu bạn nghĩ hình bên trái là <unk> và hình bên phải là Jazz thì xin mời bạn vỗ tay </s>
<s> Okay , there &apos;s some . </s> ||| <s> tốt , có vài người . </s>
<s> If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> , clap your hands . </s> ||| <s> Còn nếu bạn nghĩ bên trái là Jazz và bên phải là <unk> thì xin mời bạn vỗ tay . </s>
<s> Okay , a bit more . </s> ||| <s> Tốt rồi , nhiều hơn 1 chút . </s>
<s> Now it turns out you &apos;re right . </s> ||| <s> Bây giờ , nó chỉ ra rằng bạn đã đúng . </s>
<s> The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> , but you know what ? </s> ||| <s> Bên trái là Jazz và bên phải là <unk> , Nhưng bạn biết điều gì không </s>
<s> This is a highly useless <unk> scheme . </s> ||| <s> Đây là sự sắp xếp rất vô ích . </s>
<s> The categories need to say something to the <unk> , not the <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Sự phân chia cần phải nói lên điều gì đó tới người chọn chứ không phải là người thực hiện sự lựa chọn </s>
<s> And you often see that problem when it comes down to those long lists of all these funds . </s> ||| <s> Và bạn thường thấy rằng vấn đề đó khi nó giảm xuống trong danh sách dài của tất cả nguồn tài chính </s>
<s> Who are they actually supposed to be informing ? </s> ||| <s> Ai là người trông mong được thông tin ? </s>
<s> My fourth technique : <unk> for complexity . </s> ||| <s> Kĩ thuật thứ 4 của tôi : Điều kiện cho sự phức tạp </s>
<s> It turns out we can actually handle a lot more information than we think we can , we &apos;ve just got to take it a little easier . </s> ||| <s> Nó chỉ ra rằng chúng ta thực sự có thể giải quyết rất nhiều thông tin hơn chúng ta có thể Chúng ta có thể làm chúng 1 cách dễ hơn </s>
<s> We have to gradually increase the complexity . </s> ||| <s> Chúng ta phải dần dần tăng độ phức tạp . </s>
<s> I &apos;m going to show you one example of what I &apos;m talking about . </s> ||| <s> Tôi chuẩn bị cho bạn 1 ví dụ về điều tôi đang nói đến </s>
<s> Let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buying a car . </s> ||| <s> Hãy suy nghĩ đến 1 sự lựa chọn khó khăn : Mua 1 chiếc xe . </s>
<s> Here &apos;s a German car manufacturer that gives you the opportunity to completely custom make your car . </s> ||| <s> Đây là hãng xe của Đức mà cho bạn có cơ hội để tuỳ chỉnh xe theo ý bạn bạn muốn </s>
<s> You &apos;ve got to make 60 different decisions , completely make up your car . </s> ||| <s> Bạn có hơn 60 quyết định khác nhau , Để hoàn thành trang trí cho xe của bạn . </s>
<s> Now these decisions vary in the number of choices that they offer per decision . </s> ||| <s> Và những lựa chọn đó làm thay đổi 1 lượng sự lựa chọn mà họ đưa ra mỗi quyết định . </s>
<s> <unk> colors , exterior car colors -- I &apos;ve got 56 choices . </s> ||| <s> Màu xe , màu bên ngoài Tôi có <unk> 56 <unk> lựa chọn </s>
<s> <unk> , <unk> -- four choices . </s> ||| <s> Động cơ , sang <unk> Có 4 lựa chọn </s>
<s> So now what I &apos;m going to do is I &apos;m going to vary the order in which these decisions appear . </s> ||| <s> Cho nên điều tôi sẽ làm là tôi sẽ thay đổi sự đặt hàng mà những quyết định đó tồn tại </s>
<s> So half of the customers are going to go from high choice , 56 car colors , to low choice , four <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Cho nên 1 nửa khách hàng đi từ nhiều sự lựa chọn , 56 màu xe , tới 4 sự lựa chọn , 4 động cơ sang số . </s>
<s> The other half of the customers are going to go from low choice , four <unk> , to 56 car colors , high choice . </s> ||| <s> Còn 1 nửa khách hàng còn lại , đi từ sự lựa chọn thấp hơn , 4 động cơ sang số sau đó tới sự lựa chọn cao hơn , 56 màu xe . </s>
<s> What am I going to look at ? </s> ||| <s> Điều tôi muốn nói là gì ? </s>
<s> How engaged you are . </s> ||| <s> Bạn thật bận rộn đó . </s>
<s> If you keep hitting the default button per decision , that means you &apos;re getting overwhelmed , that means I &apos;m losing you . </s> ||| <s> Nếu bạn cứ nhấn nút &quot; mặc định &quot; cho mỗi quyết định Điều đó có nghĩa bạn đang bị quá nhiều lựa chọn , Điều đó có nghĩa là bạn thua tôi rồi </s>
<s> What you find is the people who go from high choice to low choice , they &apos;re hitting that default button over and over and over again . </s> ||| <s> Điều bạn tìm kiếm đó là mọi người đi từ sự lựa chọn nhiều xuống thấp hơn nọ đang nhấn nút &quot; mặc định &quot; tiếp và tiếp tục lần nữa . </s>
<s> We &apos;re losing them . </s> ||| <s> Chúng tôi đang thua họ </s>
<s> They go from low choice to high choice , they &apos;re hanging in there . </s> ||| <s> Họ đi từ sự lựa chọn thấp lên cao hơn thì họ đang mắc kẹt ở đó . </s>
<s> It &apos;s the same information . It &apos;s the same number of choices . </s> ||| <s> Với cùng nguồn thông tin , cùng số lượng sự lựa chọn . </s>
<s> The only thing that I have done is I have varied the order in which that information is presented . </s> ||| <s> Điều duy nhất tôi hoàn thành là Tôi đã thay đổi đơn đặt hàng mà thông tin đó được biểu hiện trong đó </s>
<s> If I start you off easy , I learn how to choose . </s> ||| <s> Nếu tôi bắt đầu với bạn dễ dàng , tôi học làm thế nào lựa chọn . </s>
<s> Even though choosing <unk> doesn &apos;t tell me anything about my preferences for interior <unk> , it still <unk> me for how to choose . </s> ||| <s> Thậm chí chọn động cơ sang số không nói tôi bất kì điều gì về sự quan tâm với trang trí bên trong , Nó vẫn cho giúp tôi biết làm sao lựa chọn </s>
<s> It also gets me excited about this big product that I &apos;m putting together , so I &apos;m more willing to be motivated to be engaged . </s> ||| <s> Nó cũng cho tôi sự hào hứng về sản phẩm to lớn này mà tôi gắn bó với nó so nên tôi rất vui được thúc đẩy và tôi bận rộn </s>
<s> So let me recap . </s> ||| <s> Để tôi khái quát lại . </s>
<s> I have talked about four techniques for <unk> the problem of choice overload -- cut -- get rid of the <unk> alternatives ; <unk> -- make it real ; <unk> -- we can handle more categories , less choices ; condition for complexity . </s> ||| <s> Tôi đã nói về bốn kĩ thuật để giải quyết vấn để quá tải trong sự lựa chọn Cắt giảm - Giảm thiểu tối đa những khả năng ngoài luồng . Cụ thể hoá - Làm cho nó thực tế hơn . Phân loại - Chúng ta giải quyết nhiều sự phân loại hơn , thì càng ít sự lựa chọn hơn Điều kiện cho sự phức tạp . </s>
<s> All of these techniques that I &apos;m describing to you today are designed to help you manage your choices -- better for you , you can use them on yourself , better for the people that you are serving . </s> ||| <s> Tất cả những kí thuật mà tôi giới thiệu bạn hôm nay được thiết kế để giúp bạn điều khiển sự lựa chọn của bạn tốt hơn và bạn có thể ứng dụng cho bản thân Người bạn phục vụ cũng tốt hơn </s>
<s> Because I believe that the key to getting the most from choice is to be <unk> about choosing . </s> ||| <s> Bởi vì tôi tin rằng chìa khoá để chọn cái tốt nhất từ sự lựa chọn đó là sự kĩ càng trong lựa chọn </s>
<s> And the more we &apos;re able to be <unk> about choosing the better we will be able to practice the art of choosing . </s> ||| <s> và chúng ta càng có thê kĩ lưỡng hơn trong lựa chọn Chúng ta càng có thể tốt hơn trong việc thực hành nghệ thuật lựa chọn </s>
<s> Thank you very much . </s> ||| <s> Cảm ơn các bạn rất nhiều </s>
<s> I think we have to do something about a piece of the culture of medicine that has to change . </s> ||| <s> Tôi nghĩ ta phải làm gì đó về một &quot; truyền thống &quot; trong y học cần phải thay đổi . </s>
<s> And I think it starts with one physician , and that &apos;s me . </s> ||| <s> Và tôi nghĩ việc này bắt đầu từ một bác sĩ , đó là tôi . </s>
<s> And maybe I &apos;ve been around long enough that I can afford to give away some of my false <unk> to be able to do that . </s> ||| <s> Và có lẽ tôi đã hành nghề đủ lâu để bỏ đi một chút cái uy tín mà tôi không đáng hưởng để có thể làm việc đó . </s>
<s> Before I actually begin the meat of my talk , let &apos;s begin with a bit of baseball . </s> ||| <s> Trước khi tôi thật sự bắt đầu phần quan trọng của buổi thuyết trình , hãy bắt đầu bằng chuyện bóng chày nhé . </s>
<s> Hey , why not ? </s> ||| <s> Ồ , tại sao không ? </s>
<s> We &apos;re near the end , we &apos;re getting close to the World <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Chúng ta sắp tới đích rồi , chúng ta sắp lọt vào cúp thế giới rồi . </s>
<s> We all love baseball , don &apos;t we ? </s> ||| <s> Ai mà chẳng yêu bóng chày , có phải không ? </s>
<s> <unk> is filled with some amazing statistics . </s> ||| <s> Môn bóng chày đầy rẫy những con số thống kê đáng kinh ngạc . </s>
<s> And there &apos;s hundreds of them . </s> ||| <s> Và có hàng trăm con số như thế . </s>
<s> &quot; <unk> &quot; is about to come out , and it &apos;s all about statistics and using statistics to build a great baseball team . </s> ||| <s> Quyển sách &quot; Bóng tiền &quot; sắp được phát hành , và cơ bản nó nói về số liệu thống kê và việc dùng số liệu để xây dựng một đội bóng chày tuyệt đỉnh . </s>
<s> I &apos;m going to focus on one <unk> that I hope a lot of you have heard of . </s> ||| <s> Tôi sẽ tập trung vào một con số mà tôi hi vọng nhiều bạn đã nghe nói tới . </s>
<s> It &apos;s called <unk> average . </s> ||| <s> Đó là chỉ số đập bóng . </s>
<s> So we talk about a 300 , a <unk> who bats 300 . </s> ||| <s> Ví dụ là số 300 nhé , một cầu thủ đập bóng 300 . </s>
<s> That means that <unk> <unk> safely , hit safely three times out of 10 at bats . </s> ||| <s> Thế nghĩa là cứ 10 lần đập bóng thì cầu thủ đó đập bóng an toàn 3 lần . </s>
<s> That means hit the ball into the <unk> , it dropped , it didn &apos;t get caught , and whoever tried to throw it to first base didn &apos;t get there in time and the runner was safe . </s> ||| <s> Nghĩa là bóng rơi vào khu vực sân ngoài , nó rơi xuống , nó không bị bắt , và cầu thủ đội bạn muốn ném bóng về lại căn cứ thứ nhất không chạy tới kịp và người chạy an toàn . </s>
<s> Three times out of 10 . </s> ||| <s> Cứ 10 lần thì có 3 lần như vậy . </s>
<s> Do you know what they call a 300 <unk> in Major League <unk> ? </s> ||| <s> Bạn có biết một cầu thủ với chỉ số đập bóng 300 trong Giải Vô <unk> Bóng <unk> Lớn được gọi là gì không ? </s>
<s> Good , really good , maybe an <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Tốt , cực tốt , có thể là siêu sao . </s>
<s> Do you know what they call a 400 baseball <unk> ? </s> ||| <s> Thế bạn có biết người ta gọi một cầu thủ với chỉ số 400 là gì không ? </s>
<s> That &apos;s somebody who hit , by the way , four times safely out of every 10 . </s> ||| <s> Tiện thể , đó là một cầu thủ đập bóng cứ 10 lần được 4 lần an toàn . </s>
<s> <unk> -- as in Ted Williams legendary -- the last Major League <unk> player to hit over 400 during a regular season . </s> ||| <s> <unk> thoại -- huyền thoại cỡ lớn như là Ted Williams -- cầu thủ Giải Vô <unk> Bóng <unk> Lớn cuối cùng đạt chỉ số trên 400 trong một mùa giải . </s>
<s> Now let &apos;s take this back into my world of medicine where I &apos;m a lot more comfortable , or perhaps a bit less comfortable after what I &apos;m going to talk to you about . </s> ||| <s> Thế , hãy áp dụng câu chuyện này vào thế giới y học của tôi một chủ đề dễ chịu nhiều hơn đối với tôi , mà có lẽ lại kém dễ chịu hơn một chút sau những gì tôi sắp trình bày với các bạn đây . </s>
<s> Suppose you have <unk> and you &apos;re referred to a surgeon who &apos;s <unk> 400 on <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Giả dụ bạn bị viêm ruột thừa và bạn được đưa tới một bác sĩ giải phẫu với chỉ số phẫu thuật ruột thừa là 400 . </s>

<s> But , but , you know what ? </s> ||| <s> Nhưng , nhưng , bạn có biết không ? </s>
<s> She &apos;s doing a lot better this year . She &apos;s on the comeback trail . </s> ||| <s> Cô bác sĩ tim kia năm nay lên tay nghề nhiều . Cô đang có một chuỗi thành công . </s>
<s> And she &apos;s hitting a <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Và đạt chỉ số những <unk> . </s>
<s> Somehow this isn &apos;t working . </s> ||| <s> Rõ là thế này vẫn chưa ổn . </s>
<s> But I &apos;m going to ask you a question . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng tôi sẽ hỏi các bạn một câu . </s>
<s> What do you think a <unk> average for a cardiac surgeon or a nurse <unk> or an orthopedic surgeon , an <unk> , a <unk> is supposed to be ? </s> ||| <s> Các bạn nghĩ chỉ số &apos; đập bóng &apos; cho một bác sĩ phẫu thuật tim , một y tá hay là bác sĩ phẫu thuật chỉnh hình , một bác sĩ phụ sản , một y sĩ là bao nhiêu ? </s>
<s> 1,000 , very good . </s> ||| <s> 1000 , tuyệt vời . </s>
<s> Now truth of the matter is , nobody knows in all of medicine what a good surgeon or physician or <unk> is supposed to bat . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng trên thực tế không ai biết trong cả nền y khoa một bác sĩ phẫu thuật tốt hay một y sĩ phải cần &apos; đập &apos; quả bóng nào . </s>
<s> What we do though is we send each one of them , including myself , out into the world with the <unk> , be perfect . </s> ||| <s> Việc ta làm là đẩy họ , kể cả tôi vào thế giới với lời răn dạy , phải hoàn hảo . </s>
<s> Never ever , ever make a mistake , but you worry about the details , about how that &apos;s going to happen . </s> ||| <s> Không bao giờ , tuyệt đối không được phạm sai lầm , nhưng anh lo lắng về từng chi tiết nhỏ , về việc làm thế nào để không phạm sai lầm . </s>
<s> And that was the message that I absorbed when I was in <unk> school . </s> ||| <s> Và đó là thông điệp tôi thấm nhuần khi tôi học trường y . </s>
<s> I was an <unk> <unk> student . </s> ||| <s> Tôi là một học sinh bị ám ảnh bởi sự hoàn hảo . </s>
<s> In high school , a <unk> once said that Brian Goldman would study for a blood test . </s> ||| <s> Ở trường phổ thông , bạn cùng lớp tôi nói rằng đi kiểm tra máu thì Brian Goldman cũng học . </s>
<s> And so I did . </s> ||| <s> Và thế là tôi cố hoàn hảo . </s>
<s> And I studied in my little <unk> at the nurses &apos; <unk> at Toronto General Hospital , not far from here . </s> ||| <s> Tôi học trong cái gác <unk> nhỏ bé của tôi ở khu tập thể y tá ở Bệnh viện Đa khoa Toronto , không xa chỗ này lắm . </s>
<s> And I memorized everything . </s> ||| <s> Và tôi thuộc <unk> mọi thứ . </s>
<s> I memorized in my anatomy class the origins and <unk> of every muscle , every branch of every artery that came off the aorta , differential diagnoses obscure and common . </s> ||| <s> Tôi học thuộc trong lớp giải phẫu điểm bắt đầu và hoạt động của từng bó cơ , từng nhánh của từng động mạch tách ra từ động mạch chủ , những căn bệnh phức tạp , cả hiếm gặp và thông dụng . </s>
<s> I even knew the differential diagnosis in how to classify <unk> <unk> <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Tôi biết cả những phương án chẩn bệnh khác nhau khi phân loại bệnh tăng axit do ống thận . </s>

<s> And I did well , I graduated with <unk> , <unk> <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Tôi thi tốt , tôi tốt nghiệp xuất sắc , loại ưu . </s>
<s> And I came out of medical school with the impression that if I memorized everything and knew everything , or as much as possible , as close to everything as possible , that it would <unk> me against making mistakes . </s> ||| <s> Và tôi tốt nghiệp trường y với ấn tượng là nếu tôi nhớ hết và biết hết , hay là càng nhiều càng tốt , càng gần &apos; biết hết &apos; &apos; càng tốt , tôi sẽ miễn dịch với vấn đề phạm sai lầm . </s>
<s> And it worked for a while , until I met Mrs. <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Và giả thuyết ấy có vẻ đúng được một lúc cho tới khi tôi gặp bà <unk> . </s>
<s> I was a resident at a teaching hospital here in Toronto when Mrs. <unk> was brought to the emergency department of the hospital where I was working . </s> ||| <s> Tôi đang thực tập ở một bệnh viện trực thuộc trường y ngay tại Toronto này khi bà <unk> được chuyển vào phòng cấp cứu của bệnh viện nơi tôi làm việc . </s>

<s> This is a condition in which the heart fails , and instead of being able to pump all the blood forward , some of the blood backs up into the lung , the lungs fill up with blood , and that &apos;s why you have <unk> of breath . </s> ||| <s> Tình trạng này diễn ra khi tim không hoạt động bình thường , và thay vì co bóp đẩy máu đi , một ít máu trào lại vào phổi , và rồi máu ngập đầy phổi , và thế nên bệnh nhân khó thở . </s>
<s> And that wasn &apos;t a difficult diagnosis to make . </s> ||| <s> <unk> đoán bệnh này không phải là khó . </s>
<s> I made it and I set to work treating her . </s> ||| <s> Tôi chẩn bệnh và bắt đầu điều trị cho bà . </s>
<s> I gave her <unk> . I gave her medications to <unk> the strain on her heart . </s> ||| <s> Tôi cho bà uống <unk> . Tôi kê thuốc để giảm hoạt động của tim . </s>
<s> I gave her medications that we call <unk> , water pills , to get her to pee out the access fluid . </s> ||| <s> Tôi kê thuốc lợi tiểu để bà đi tiểu bớt dịch thừa . </s>
<s> And over the course of the next hour and a half or two , she started to feel better . </s> ||| <s> Và trong vòng chừng một tiếng rưỡi , hai tiếng sau đó , bà bắt đầu thấy dễ chịu hơn . </s>
<s> And I felt really good . </s> ||| <s> Và tôi cũng thấy tốt . </s>
<s> And that &apos;s when I made my first mistake ; I sent her home . </s> ||| <s> Và đó là lúc tôi phạm sai lầm đầu tiên ; tôi cho bà xuất viện . </s>
<s> Actually , I made two more mistakes . </s> ||| <s> Thực ra , tôi phạm 2 sai lầm nữa . </s>
<s> I sent her home without speaking to my attending . </s> ||| <s> Tôi cho bà xuất viện mà không nói trước cho bác sĩ giám sát . </s>
<s> I didn &apos;t pick up the phone and do what I was supposed to do , which was call my attending and run the story by him so he would have a chance to see her for himself . </s> ||| <s> Tôi không nhấc điện thoại và làm việc mà đáng lẽ tôi phải làm , là gọi cho bác sĩ giám sát và thuật lại mọi sự cho anh để anh có cơ hội gặp trực tiếp bệnh nhân . </s>
<s> And he knew her , he would have been able to <unk> additional information about her . </s> ||| <s> Và anh biết bệnh nhân , anh sẽ có thể thêm thông tin về bà . </s>
<s> Maybe I did it for a good reason . </s> ||| <s> Có lẽ tôi có lí do đúng đắn . </s>
<s> Maybe I didn &apos;t want to be a <unk> resident . </s> ||| <s> Có lẽ tôi không muốn làm một thực tập viên phiền nhiễu . </s>
<s> Maybe I wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that I would do so and I would be able to take care of my attending &apos;s patients without even having to contact him . </s> ||| <s> Có lẽ tôi đã muốn thật thành công và tự chịu trách nhiệm nên nỗi tôi làm thế và tự chăm sóc bệnh nhân của bác sĩ hướng dẫn mà còn không liên lạc với anh . </s>
<s> The second mistake that I made was worse . </s> ||| <s> <unk> lầm thứ hai của tôi còn tệ hơn . </s>
<s> In sending her home , I <unk> a little voice deep down inside that was trying to tell me , &quot; Goldman , not a good idea .

<s> In fact , so lacking in confidence was I that I actually asked the nurse who was looking after Mrs. <unk> , &quot; Do you think it &apos;s okay if she goes home ? &quot; </s> ||| <s> Thực tế là , tôi thiếu tự tin đến mức tôi hỏi chị y tá đang chăm sóc bà <unk> , &quot; Chị nghĩ cho bà ấy xuất viện có ổn không ? &quot; </s>
<s> And the nurse thought about it and said very <unk> , &quot; Yeah , I think she &apos;ll do okay . &quot; </s> ||| <s> Và chị y tá nghĩ một lúc và nói đơn giản là , &quot; Ồ , tôi nghĩ là bà ấy sẽ ổn thôi . &quot; </s>
<s> I can remember that like it was yesterday . </s> ||| <s> Tôi nhớ rõ mọi sự như ngày hôm qua vậy . </s>
<s> So I signed the <unk> papers , and an ambulance came , <unk> came to take her home . </s> ||| <s> Thế là tôi kí giấy tờ xuất viện , và xe cứu thương tới , y sĩ đưa bà về nhà . </s>
<s> And I went back to my work on the <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Và tôi quay lại làm việc ở phòng khám . </s>
<s> All the rest of that day , that afternoon , I had this kind of <unk> feeling inside my stomach . </s> ||| <s> Phần còn lại ngày hôm đó , chiều đó , Tôi có cảm giác nôn nao trong lòng . </s>
<s> But I carried on with my work . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng tôi vẫn tiếp tục làm việc . </s>
<s> And at the end of the day , I packed up to leave the hospital and walked to the parking lot to take my car and drive home when I did something that I don &apos;t usually do . </s> ||| <s> Đến hết ngày , tôi dọn dẹp rời bệnh viện và đi bộ tới bãi gửi xe , để lấy ô-tô lái về nhà rồi tôi làm một việc mà tôi không thường làm . </s>
<s> I walked through the emergency department on my way home . </s> ||| <s> Tôi đi qua phòng cấp cứu trên đường về nhà . </s>

<s> Others in medicine dread them as well , but there &apos;s something particular about emergency medicine because we see patients so <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Ai làm trong ngành y cũng kinh hãi 3 chữ ấy , nhưng y khoa cấp cứu còn đặc biệt hơn nữa vì chúng tôi gặp bệnh nhân quá ngắn ngủi . </s>
<s> The three words are : Do you remember ? </s> ||| <s> 3 chữ ấy là : Có nhớ không ? </s>
<s> &quot; Do you remember that patient you sent home ? &quot; </s> ||| <s> &quot; Anh có nhớ bệnh nhân anh cho xuất viện không ? &quot; </s>
<s> the other nurse asked <unk> . </s> ||| <s> y tá kia hỏi đơn giản như thế . </s>
<s> &quot; Well she &apos;s back , &quot; in just that tone of voice . </s> ||| <s> &quot; Ồ , bà ấy quay lại rồi , &quot; đúng với giọng như thế . </s>
<s> Well she was back all right . </s> ||| <s> Ồ được rồi , bà phải quay lại . </s>

<s> And two days later I came to do my next emergency shift , and that &apos;s when my chief asked to speak to me quietly in her office . </s> ||| <s> Và hai ngày sau tôi đến ca trực cấp cứu tiếp theo , và đó là lúc cấp trên của tôi yêu cầu nói chuyện riêng với tôi trong phòng bà . </s>
<s> And she said the three words : Do you remember ? </s> ||| <s> Và bà nói ba chữ này : Có nhớ không ? </s>

<s> And fortunately he didn &apos;t die . </s> ||| <s> Và may mắn là anh bệnh nhân không chết . </s>
<s> He was placed on <unk> antibiotics and he recovered after a few days . </s> ||| <s> Anh phải tiêm thuốc kháng sinh và hồi phục sau vài ngày . </s>

<s> <unk> in one emergency shift , I missed <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Hai lần trong một ca trực cấp cứu , tôi không chẩn đúng bệnh viêm ruột thừa . </s>

<s> Now in both cases , I didn &apos;t send them home and I don &apos;t think there was any gap in their care . </s> ||| <s> Trong cả hai trường hợp , tôi không cho bệnh nhân xuất viện và tôi không nghĩ là chăm sóc có gì thiếu sót cả . </s>
<s> One I thought had a kidney stone . </s> ||| <s> Có một bệnh nhân tôi nghĩ là bị sỏi thận . </s>
<s> I ordered a kidney X-ray .

<s> But each time , they were <unk> at me , eating at me . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng mỗi lần , họ đều giày vò tôi , ngấu nghiến nhìn tôi . </s>
<s> And I &apos;d like to be able to say to you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice as many of my colleagues say , which is total <unk> </s> ||| <s> Và tôi muốn được nói với các bạn rằng những sai lầm tệ hại nhất của tôi chỉ diễn ra trong năm năm hành nghề đầu tiên như nhiều đồng nghiệp của tôi nói , toàn là rác rưởi . </s>

<s> <unk> , ashamed and <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Cô độc , <unk> hổ , không được trợ giúp . </s>
<s> Here &apos;s the problem : If I can &apos;t come clean and talk about my mistakes , if I can &apos;t find the <unk> voice that tells me what really happened , how can I share it with my colleagues ? </s> ||| <s> Vấn đề là thế này : Nếu tôi không thể nói trắng ra nói về sai lầm của tôi , nếu tôi để lạc mất tiếng nói lương tâm nhỏ bé ngày nào tiếng nói cho tôi biết điều gì thực sự xảy ra , làm sao tôi sẻ chia với đồng nghiệp được ? </s>
<s> How can I teach them about what I did so that they don &apos;t do the same thing ? </s> ||| <s> Làm sao tôi dạy cho họ là tôi đã làm gì để họ không đi vào vết xe đổ ? </s>
<s> If I were to walk into a room -- like right now , I have no idea what you think of me . </s> ||| <s> Nếu tôi đi vào một căn phòng -- như lúc này , tôi hoàn toàn không biết các bạn sẽ nghĩ gì về tôi . </s>

<s> Oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party and you might hear about some other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talking about their own mistakes . </s> ||| <s> À vâng , bạn tới một bữa tiệc thân mật và có lẽ bạn nghe chuyện kể về một gã bác sĩ nào đó , nhưng bạn sẽ không nghe ai đó thuật lại sai lầm của chính họ . </s>
<s> If I were to walk into a room filled with my <unk> and ask for their support right now and start to tell what I &apos;ve just told you right now , I probably wouldn &apos;t get through two of those stories before they would start to get really uncomfortable , somebody would crack a joke , they &apos;d change the subject and we would move on . </s> ||| <s> Nếu tôi phải đi vào một căn phòng đầy những đồng nghiệp của tôi và nhờ họ giúp đỡ ngay bây giờ và bắt đầu kể những gì tôi vừa kể cho các bạn , có lẽ tôi chẳng kể được hết hai chuyện trước khi họ thấy vô cùng khó chịu , ai đó sẽ pha trò , họ sẽ chuyển chủ đề và chúng tôi sẽ tiếp tục hội thoại . </s>
<s> And in fact , if I knew and my colleagues knew that one of my orthopedic colleagues took off the wrong leg in my hospital , believe me , I &apos;d have trouble making eye contact with that person . </s> ||| <s> Và thực tế là , nếu tôi biết và đồng nghiệp tôi cũng biết rằng một đồng nghiệp khoa chỉnh hình của tôi cưa nhầm chân lành của bệnh nhân , trong chính bệnh viện của tôi , tin tôi đi , tôi sẽ gặp khó khăn mà nhìn vào mắt kẻ tội đồ kia được . </s>
<s> That &apos;s the system that we have . </s> ||| <s> Đó là hệ thống ta có . </s>
<s> It &apos;s a complete denial of mistakes . </s> ||| <s> Một sự chối bỏ hoàn toàn sai lầm . </s>
<s> It &apos;s a system in which there are two kinds of physicians -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t , those who can &apos;t handle sleep deprivation and those who can , those who have lousy outcomes and those who have great outcomes . </s> ||| <s> Đó là một hệ thống trong đó có hai vị trí -- những kẻ phạm sai lầm và những người không sai lầm , những bác sĩ không chịu được thiếu ngủ , và người chịu được , người có kết cục tệ hại và người có kết cục thành công . </s>
<s> And it &apos;s almost like an ideological reaction , like the antibodies begin to attack that person . </s> ||| <s> Và nó gần như là một phản ứng trong tâm tưởng , như khi kháng thể bắt đầu tấn công người đó . </s>
<s> And we have this idea that if we drive the people who make mistakes out of medicine , what will we be left with , but a safe system . </s> ||| <s> Và chúng tôi có ý tưởng này rằng nếu chúng tôi tống khứ những người phạm sai lầm ra khỏi nền y học , cái còn lại đơn giản là một hệ thống an toàn . </s>
<s> But there are two problems with that . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng có hai vấn đề với điều đó . </s>
<s> In my 20 years or so of medical broadcasting and journalism , I &apos;ve made a personal study of medical <unk> and medical errors to learn everything I can , from one of the first articles I wrote for the Toronto Star to my show &quot; White <unk> , Black Art . &quot; </s> ||| <s> Trong chừng 20 năm tôi viết báo và làm tuyền thông về y học , tôi đã tự nghiên cứu sơ suất và sai lầm trong y học để học mọi điều có thể , từ một trong những bài đầu tiên tôi viết cho tờ Toronto Star tới chương trình truyền hình của tôi &quot; Áo <unk> Trắng , Nghệ Thuật Đen . &quot; </s>
<s> And what I &apos;ve learned is that errors are absolutely ubiquitous . </s> ||| <s> Và điều tôi học được là sai sót có mặt khắp nơi . </s>
<s> We work in a system where errors happen every day , where one in 10 medications are either the wrong medication given in hospital or at the wrong dosage , where <unk> infections are getting more and more numerous , causing havoc and death . </s> ||| <s> Ta làm việc trong một hệ thống trong đó sai sót xảy ra hàng ngày , trong đó cứ 10 đơn thuốc thì có 1 đơn hoặc là kê nhầm thuốc hoặc là kê nhầm liều lượng , trong đó các ca nhiễm khuẩn bắt nguồn từ bệnh viện ngày càng nhiều , dẫn tới tàn phá cơ thể và chết chóc . </s>
<s> In this country , as many as 24,000 Canadians die of preventable medical errors . </s> ||| <s> Trong đất nước này , tới <unk> người dân Canada qua đời vì những sai sót y học có thể phòng tránh được . </s>
<s> In the United States , the Institute of Medicine <unk> it at 100,000 . </s> ||| <s> Ở Hoa Kì , Viện Y Học đặt ra con số 100000 . </s>
<s> In both cases , these are gross <unk> , because we really aren &apos;t <unk> out the problem as we should . </s> ||| <s> Trong cả hai trường hợp , đây đều là những ước đoán quá thấp so với thực tế , bởi vì thực tế ta chưa từng truy tìm kĩ vấn nạn này mà đáng lẽ chúng ta phải như thế . </s>
<s> And here &apos;s the thing . </s> ||| <s> Và vấn đề là đây . </s>
<s> In a hospital system where medical knowledge is doubling every two or three years , we can &apos;t keep up with it . </s> ||| <s> Trong một hệ thống bệnh viện nơi mà kiến thức y khoa tăng gấp đôi mỗi hai hay ba năm , ta không thể theo kịp . </s>
<s> Sleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive . </s> ||| <s> Sự thiếu ngủ vô cùng phổ biến . </s>
<s> We can &apos;t get rid of it . </s> ||| <s> Ta không thể tống khứ vấn đề này được . </s>
<s> We have our cognitive biases , so that I can take a perfect history on a patient with chest pain . </s> ||| <s> Chúng ta có những định kiến dựa vào kinh nghiệm sẵn có , ví dụ tôi có thể chấp nhận là một bệnh nhân đau ngực có tiền sử bệnh hoàn hảo . </s>
<s> Now take the same patient with chest pain , make them <unk> and <unk> and put a little bit of alcohol on their breath , and suddenly my history is <unk> with contempt . </s> ||| <s> Bây giờ cùng bệnh nhân bị đau ngực ấy , giả dụ anh ta ướt mồ hồi và nói lắm và thêm tí mùi cồn vào hơi thở của anh ta , và đột nhiên tiền sử bệnh của tôi bị ảnh hưởng xấu </s>
<s> I don &apos;t take the same history . </s> ||| <s> Tôi không áp dụng cùng một tiền sử bệnh nữa . </s>
<s> I &apos;m not a robot ; I don &apos;t do things the same way each time . </s> ||| <s> Tôi không phải rô-bốt ; không phải lần nào tôi cũng theo y một qui trình . </s>
<s> And my patients aren &apos;t cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms in the same way each time . </s> ||| <s> Và bệnh nhân của tôi không phải ô-tô ; không phải mỗi lần họ đều thuật lại triệu chứng theo cách giống nhau . </s>
<s> Given all of that , mistakes are inevitable . </s> ||| <s> Với những điều đó , sai lầm là bất khả kháng . </s>
<s> So if you take the system , as I was taught , and weed out all the <unk> health professionals , well there won &apos;t be anybody left . </s> ||| <s> Thế nên , nếu bạn xử lí hệ thống , như tôi được dạy , và loại bỏ tất cả những nhân viên ngành y phạm sai lầm , sẽ chẳng còn lại ai hết . </s>
<s> And you know that business about people not wanting to talk about their worst cases ? </s> ||| <s> Và bạn có biết việc người ta không muốn nói về những trường hợp tệ nhất của họ không ? </s>
<s> On my show , on &quot; White <unk> , Black Art , &quot; I made it a habit of saying , &quot; Here &apos;s my worst mistake , &quot; I would say to everybody from <unk> to the chief of cardiac surgery , &quot; Here &apos;s my worst mistake , &quot; blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; What about yours ? &quot; and I would point the microphone towards them . </s> ||| <s> Trên show truyền hình của tôi , &quot; Áo <unk> Trắng , Nghệ Thuật Đen , &quot; tôi tạo thói quen nói , &quot; Đây là sai lầm tệ nhất của tôi , &quot; tôi sẽ nói với tất cả mọi người từ nhân viên y tế , đến trưởng phòng phẫu thuật tim , &quot; Đây là sai lầm tệ nhất của tôi , &quot; blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; Thế còn của bạn là gì ? &quot; và tôi sẽ hướng mic về phía họ . </s>
<s> And their pupils would <unk> , they would <unk> , then they would look down and swallow hard and start to tell me their stories . </s> ||| <s> Và đồng tử mắt họ sẽ giãn ra , họ sẽ co <unk> sợ hãi , và rồi họ sẽ nhìn xuống và nuốt nước bọt và bắt đầu kể tôi nghe câu chuyện của họ . </s>
<s> They want to tell their stories . They want to share their stories . </s> ||| <s> Họ muốn kể câu chuyện của họ . Họ muốn sẻ chia câu chuyện của họ . </s>
<s> They want to be able to say , &quot; Look , don &apos;t make the same mistake I did . &quot; </s> ||| <s> Họ muốn được nói rằng , &quot; Xem này , đừng đi vào vết xe đổ của tôi . &quot; </s>
<s> What they need is an environment to be able to do that . </s> ||| <s> Điều họ cần là một môi trường tạo điều kiện cho họ nói điều đó . </s>
<s> What they need is a redefined medical culture . </s> ||| <s> Điều họ cần là một văn hoá y học cần xác định lại . </s>
<s> And it starts with one physician at a time . </s> ||| <s> Và việc này bắt đầu từ từng y sĩ một . </s>
<s> The redefined physician is human , knows she &apos;s human , accepts it , isn &apos;t proud of making mistakes , but <unk> to learn one thing from what happened that she can teach to somebody else . </s> ||| <s> Người y sĩ , theo khái niệm xác định lại , là con người bằng xương bằng thịt , tự biết chị chỉ là một con người , chấp nhận điều đó , chẳng tự hào gì khi nhận sai lầm , nhưng cố gắng học một điều gì đó từ việc đã xảy ra điều ấy chị có thể dạy cho ai đó khác . </s>
<s> She shares her experience with others . </s> ||| <s> Chị chia sẻ trải nghiệm ấy với những người khác . </s>
<s> She &apos;s supportive when other people talk about their mistakes . </s> ||| <s> Chị rất ủng hộ khi người khác nói về sai lầm của họ . </s>
<s> And she points out other people &apos;s mistakes , not in a <unk> way , but in a loving , supportive way so that everybody can benefit . </s> ||| <s> Và chị chỉ ra sai lầm của người khác. không phải kiểu &quot; A bắt được rồi &quot; mà một cách ủng hộ , tận tình để mọi người có thể tốt hơn . </s>
<s> And she works in a culture of medicine that <unk> that human beings run the system , and when human beings run the system , they will make mistakes from time to time . </s> ||| <s> Và chị làm việc trong văn hoá y học chấp nhận rằng hệ thống được điều khiển bởi những con người , và khi con người điều khiển hệ thống , họ sẽ có lúc phạm sai lầm . </s>
<s> So the system is evolving to create <unk> that make it easier to detect those mistakes that humans inevitably make and also <unk> in a loving , supportive way places where everybody who is observing in the health care system can actually point out things that could be potential mistakes and is rewarded for doing so , and especially people like me , when we do make mistakes , we &apos;re rewarded for coming clean . </s> ||| <s> Nên hệ thống ấy đang tiến triển để tạo ra phương án dự phòng để việc phát hiện sai lầm dễ dàng hơn những sai lầm mà con người không thể không mắc và cúng tạo ra , một cách tận tình , ủng hộ , những nơi mà bất kì ai theo dõi trong hệ thống chăm sóc sức khoẻ đều có thể chỉ ra những điều có thể trở thành sai lầm và được thưởng khi làm việc đó , và đặc biệt là những người như tôi , khi chúng tôi phạm sai lầm thật , chúng tôi được thưởng vì nói trắng ra điều đó . </s>

<s> It &apos;s been seen nearly 200 million times this year . </s> ||| <s> với gần 200 triệu lượt xem . </s>
<s> This is a chart of what it looked like . </s> ||| <s> Đây là biểu đồ mô tả điều đó . </s>
<s> And similar to &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; it seems to have just <unk> up out of nowhere . </s> ||| <s> Và tương tự như &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; Có vẻ như nó chỉ nổi lên từ chỗ không có gì cả . </s>
<s> So what happened on this day ? </s> ||| <s> Vậy điều gì xảy ra vào ngày này ? </s>
<s> Well it was a Friday , this is true . </s> ||| <s> À , nó là một ngày thứ 6 , đúng thế . </s>
<s> And if you &apos;re wondering about those other spikes , those are also <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Và nếu như bạn đang tự hỏi về những đỉnh điểm khác , chúng cũng vào những ngày thứ 6 . </s>

<s> Well <unk> picked it up , a lot of blogs starting writing about . </s> ||| <s> À , <unk> đã xem , và nhiều trang nhật ký trực tuyến bắt đầu viết về nó . </s>
<s> Michael <unk> Nelson from Mystery Science <unk> was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on Twitter . </s> ||| <s> Michael <unk> Nelson từ Nhà hát khoa học bí ẩn là một trong những người đầu tiên đăng một câu chuyện đùa về video này trên mạng xã hội Twitter . </s>
<s> But what &apos;s important is that an individual or a group of <unk> took a point of view and they shared that with a larger audience , accelerating the process . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng điều quan trọng đó là một cá nhân hoặc một nhóm thuộc những người tạo ra trào lưu có một quan điểm và họ chia sẻ với nhiều khán giả hơn , giúp đẩy nhanh quá trình phổ biến nó . </s>
<s> And so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it . </s> ||| <s> Và thế là sau đó cộng đồng này được tạo ra từ những người biết đến câu chuyện cười này và họ bắt đầu nói và làm một số điều về nó . </s>
<s> And now there are 10,000 <unk> of &quot; Friday &quot; on YouTube . </s> ||| <s> Kết quả là bây giờ có hơn 10000 phiên bản bắt chước &quot; <unk> &quot; trên YouTube . </s>
<s> Even in the first seven days , there was one parody for every other day of the week . </s> ||| <s> Thậm chí trong 7 ngày đầu tiên , trong mỗi ngày đã có một video nhại theo được đăng tải . </s>
<s> Unlike the one-way entertainment of the 20th century , this community participation is how we become a part of the phenomenon -- either by spreading it or by doing something new with it . </s> ||| <s> Không giống như kiểu giải trí một chiều của thế kỉ 20 , tham gia cộng đồng này là cách chúng ta trở thành một phần của hiện tượng bằng việc lan truyền hoặc làm điều gì đó mới mẻ với nó . </s>
<s> So &quot; <unk> Cat &quot; is a <unk> animation with <unk> music . </s> ||| <s> &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; là một hình ảnh hoạt hình được lặp lại với nhạc lặp lại . </s>

<s> What scripts could you have written that would have contained this in it ? </s> ||| <s> Bạn có thể viết kịch bản gì chứa đựng điều này trong đó ? </s>
<s> In a world where over two days of video get uploaded every minute , only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things have . </s> ||| <s> Trong một thế giới mà số video có thời lượng hơn 2 ngày được tải lên mỗi phút , chỉ điều thực sự độc đáo và bất ngờ đó có thể gây chú ý theo cái cách mà những điều này có . </s>
<s> When a friend of mine told me that I needed to see this great video about a guy protesting bicycle <unk> in New York City , I admit I wasn &apos;t very interested . </s> ||| <s> Khi một người bạn của tôi nói với tôi rằng tôi cần xem đoạn video tuyệt vời này về một người phản đối những khoản phạt người đi xe đạp ở thành phố New York , Tôi phải thừa nhận tôi không hứng thú lắm . </s>
<s> So I got a ticket for not riding in the bike lane , but often there are <unk> that keep you from properly riding in the bike lane . </s> ||| <s> Video của Vậy là tôi nhận vé phạt vì đã không đi xe đạp trong đúng làn đường dành cho xe đạp , nhưng thường có những vật cản khiến bạn không đi đúng vào làn đường dành cho xe đạp . </s>

<s> And we all now feel some ownership in our own pop culture . </s> ||| <s> Và tất cả chúng ta đều cảm thấy vài sự sở hữu trong nền văn hoá nhạc pop của chính mình . </s>
<s> And these are not characteristics of old media , and they &apos;re barely true of the media of today , but they will define the entertainment of the future . </s> ||| <s> Và những điều này không phải là những đặc điểm của phương tiện truyền thông trước đó , cũng như hầu như không đúng với phương tiện truyền thông ngày nay , nhưng chúng sẽ quyết định cách giải trí của tương lai . </s>

<s> My story begins right here actually in Rajasthan about two years ago . </s> ||| <s> Câu chuyện của tôi bắt đầu ngay tại đây , ở Rajasthan khoảng hai năm về trước . </s>
<s> I was in the desert , under the starry skies with the Sufi singer <unk> Ali . </s> ||| <s> Lúc đó tôi đang ở trong sa mạc , dưới bầu trời sao cùng ca sĩ theo đạo <unk> , <unk> Ali . </s>
<s> And we were in conversation about how nothing had changed since the time of the ancient Indian epic &quot; The <unk> . &quot; </s> ||| <s> Chúng tôi trò chuyện là thời cuộc chẳng có gì thay đổi từ thời có bản sử thi Ấn Độ cổ đại <unk> . </s>
<s> So back in the day , when us Indians wanted to travel we &apos;d jump into a <unk> and we &apos;d zoom across the sky . </s> ||| <s> Thời đó , khi người Ấn chúng tôi muốn đi lại chúng tôi sẽ nhảy vào một cỗ xe ngựa và phóng <unk> qua bầu trời . </s>
<s> Now we do the same with airplanes . </s> ||| <s> Ngày nay , chúng ta cũng làm điều tương tự với máy bay . </s>
<s> Back then , when <unk> , the great Indian warrior prince , when he was thirsty , he &apos;d take out a bow , he &apos;d shoot it into the ground and water would come out . </s> ||| <s> Thời đó , khi <unk> , vị hoàng tử chiến binh Ấn Độ vĩ đại , khi khát nước , chàng sẽ rút cung tên , chàng bắn vào mặt đất và nước sẽ phun ra . </s>
<s> Now we do the same with drills and machines . </s> ||| <s> Ngày nay , chúng ta cũng làm thế bằng khoan và máy móc . </s>
<s> The conclusion that we came to was that magic had been replaced by machinery . </s> ||| <s> Kết luận chúng tôi rút ra là phép màu đã &apos; được &apos; thay thế bằng máy móc . </s>
<s> And this made me really sad . </s> ||| <s> Và điều này khiến tôi buồn vô cùng . </s>
<s> I found myself becoming a little bit of a <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Tự nhiên tôi thấy mình trở thành kẻ sợ công nghệ . </s>
<s> I was terrified by this idea that I would lose the ability to enjoy and appreciate the sunset without having my camera on me , without tweeting it to my friends . </s> ||| <s> Tôi sợ cái ý nghĩ rằng tôi sẽ mất khả năng thích thú và thưởng thức hoàng hôn mà không <unk> <unk> chiếc máy ảnh , mà không nhắn lên Twitter cho bạn bè tôi . </s>
<s> And it felt like technology should enable magic , not kill it . </s> ||| <s> Và có vẻ như công nghệ mới đáng lẽ phải tạo ra phép màu , chứ không phải tiêu diệt nó . </s>
<s> When I was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silver pocket watch . </s> ||| <s> Khi tôi còn là một cô bé nhỏ , ông tôi tặng tôi chiếc đồng hồ bỏ túi bằng bạc . </s>
<s> And this piece of <unk> technology became the most magical thing to me . </s> ||| <s> Và cái mảnh công nghệ 50 năm tuổi này trở thành vật thể màu nhiệm nhất đối với tôi . </s>
<s> It became a <unk> gateway into a world full of pirates and <unk> and images in my imagination . </s> ||| <s> Nó trở thành cánh cổng mạ vàng mở ra một thế giới đầy những cướp biển và đắm tàu và các hình ảnh trong trí tưởng tượng của tôi . </s>
<s> So I felt like our cellphones and our fancy watches and our cameras had stopped us from dreaming . </s> ||| <s> Thế nên tôi cảm thấy như những chiếc điện thoại di động của chúng ta , những chiếc đồng hồ vui mắt và máy ảnh của chúng ta đã khiến ta thôi mơ mộng . </s>
<s> They stopped us from being inspired . </s> ||| <s> Chúng ngăn trở những cảm hứng sáng tạo . </s>
<s> And so I jumped in , I jumped into this world of technology , to see how I could use it to enable magic as opposed to kill it . </s> ||| <s> Và thế là tôi nhảy vào , nhảy vào thế giới công nghệ này , để xem tôi có thể dùng nó để tạo ra phép màu như thế nào chứ không phải là tiêu diệt nó . </s>
<s> I &apos;ve been <unk> books since I was 16 . </s> ||| <s> Tôi đã minh hoạ sách từ năm 16 tuổi . </s>
<s> And so when I saw the iPad , I saw it as a storytelling device that could connect readers all over the world . </s> ||| <s> Và thế là khi tôi thấy chiếc iPad , tôi thấy nó là một đạo cụ kể chuyện có khả năng kết nối độc giả trên khắp thế giới . </s>
<s> It can know how we &apos;re holding it . </s> ||| <s> Nó biết ta đang cầm nó như thế nào . </s>
<s> It can know where we are . </s> ||| <s> Nó biết ta đang ở đâu . </s>
<s> It brings together image and text and animation and sound and touch . </s> ||| <s> Nó kết hợp hình ảnh , chữ , minh hoạ động , âm thanh , và cảm giác chạm . </s>
<s> <unk> is becoming more and more <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Việc kể chuyện đang trở nên ngày càng đa giác quan . </s>
<s> But what are we doing with it ? </s> ||| <s> Nhưng ta đang làm gì với nó vậy ? </s>
<s> So I &apos;m actually just going to go in and launch <unk> , an interactive app for the iPad . </s> ||| <s> Thế là thật ra tôi sắp vào và khởi động <unk> , một phần mềm ứng dụng tương tác cho iPad . </s>
<s> So it says , &quot; <unk> your fingers upon each light . &quot; </s> ||| <s> Ở đây nói là , &quot; Hãy đặt tay bạn lên mỗi cái đèn , &quot; </s>
<s> And so -- It says , &quot; This box belongs to ... &quot; And so I type in my name . </s> ||| <s> Và thế là -- Nó nói , &quot; Quyển sách này là của ... &quot; Và thế là tôi gõ tên tôi vào . </s>
<s> And actually I become a character in the book . </s> ||| <s> Và trên thực tế tôi biến thành một nhân vật trong quyển sách . </s>
<s> At various points , a little letter drops down to me -- and the iPad knows where you live because of GPS -- which is actually addressed to me . </s> ||| <s> Ở vài thời điểm , một bức thư nhỏ xinh rơi xuống cho tôi -- và chiếc iPad biết bạn đang ở đâu đấy , nhờ hệ GPS -- bức thư gửi đến địa chỉ của tôi . </s>
<s> The child in me is really excited by these kinds of possibilities . </s> ||| <s> Đứa trẻ trong tôi vô cùng hứng thú bởi những khả năng như thế này . </s>
<s> Now I &apos;ve been talking a lot about magic . </s> ||| <s> Nào , tôi đã nói rất nhiều về phép màu . </s>
<s> And I don &apos;t mean <unk> and <unk> , I mean the kind of childhood magic , those ideas that we all <unk> as children . </s> ||| <s> Và ý tôi không phải là phù thuỷ hay rồng , ý tôi là loại phép màu trẻ thơ , những ý tưởng chúng ta đều ấp ủ khi còn bé . </s>
<s> This idea of fireflies in a jar , for some reason , was always really exciting to me . </s> ||| <s> Ý tưởng nhốt đom đóm trong lọ thuỷ tinh , không biết tại sao , luôn vô cùng thú vị đối với tôi . </s>
<s> And so over here you need to tilt your iPad , take the fireflies out . </s> ||| <s> Và thế là ở đây , bạn cần nghiêng iPad , để lấy đom đóm ra . </s>
<s> And they actually illuminate your way through the rest of the book . </s> ||| <s> Và chúng sẽ chiếu sáng cho bạn qua phần còn lại của quyển sách . </s>
<s> Another idea that really fascinated me as a child was that an entire galaxy could be contained within a single marble . </s> ||| <s> Một ý tưởng khác <unk> hồn tôi khi còn bé là nguyên một thiên hạ rộng lớn có thể bị thu vào một hòn bi duy nhất . </s>
<s> And so over here , each book and each world becomes a little marble that I drag in to this magical device within the device . </s> ||| <s> Và thế là ở đây , mỗi cuốn sách và mỗi thế giới trở thành một hòn bi nhỏ bé mà tôi kéo vào trong thiết bị nhiệm màu này trong một thiết bị khác . </s>
<s> And it opens up a map . </s> ||| <s> Và một bản đồ mở ra . </s>
<s> All along , all fantasy books have always had maps , but these maps have been static . </s> ||| <s> Lúc nào cũng thế , quyển sách thần tiên nào cũng có bản đồ , nhưng những bản đồ này đều tĩnh . </s>
<s> This is a map that grows and glows and becomes your navigation for the rest of the book . </s> ||| <s> Đây là một chiếc bản đồ tự phóng to ra và nhấp nháy sáng và nó vạch phương hướng cho bạn trong suốt phần còn lại của quyển sách . </s>
<s> It reveals itself to you at certain points in the book as well . </s> ||| <s> Vào vài thời điểm nhất định trong quyển sách , nó sẽ cho bạn thấy bí mật trong nó nữa . </s>
<s> So I &apos;m just going to enter in . </s> ||| <s> Thế , tôi sẽ đi vào bây giờ . </s>
<s> Another thing that &apos;s actually really important to me is creating content that is Indian and yet very contemporary . </s> ||| <s> Một điều thật sự quan trọng nữa đối với tôi là việc tạo ra nội dung thật sự Ấn Độ nhưng vẫn hiện đại . </s>
<s> Over here , these are the <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Ở đây , đây là các nàng <unk> . </s>
<s> So we &apos;ve all heard about <unk> and we &apos;ve all heard about <unk> , but how many people outside of India know about their Indian counterparts , the <unk> ? </s> ||| <s> Chúng ta đều đã nghe kể về các nàng tiên , chúng ta đều đã nghe kể về các nữ thần , nhưng có mấy ai không ở Ấn Độ mà lại biết về phiên bản Ấn Độ , các nàng <unk> ? </s>
<s> These poor <unk> have been trapped inside <unk> &apos;s chambers for thousands of years in an old and <unk> book . </s> ||| <s> Những nàng <unk> đáng thương này đã bị nhốt trong các căn phòng của <unk> suốt hàng ngàn năm trong một cuốn sách cũ kĩ mốc mọt . </s>
<s> And so we &apos;re bringing them back in a contemporary story for children . </s> ||| <s> Và thế là chũng ta mang họ trở về một cuốn sách thiếu nhi hiện đại . </s>
<s> And a story that actually deals with new issues like the environmental crisis . </s> ||| <s> Và một câu chuyện còn phản ánh những vấn đề mới như là vấn nạn môi trường . </s>
<s> Speaking of the environmental crisis , I think a big problem has been in the last 10 years is that children have been locked inside their rooms , glued to their <unk> , they haven &apos;t been able to get out . </s> ||| <s> Tiện thể nói về vấn nạn môi trường , tôi nghĩ một vấn đề lớn trong 10 năm gần đây là các em nhỏ đã bị nhốt trong phòng , dán mắt vào màn hình máy tính , các em không ra ngoài chơi được . </s>
<s> But now with mobile technology , we can actually take our children outside into the natural world with their technology . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng nay với công nghệ di động , ta có thể mang các em nhỏ ra ngoài , vào thế giới tự nhiên bằng công nghệ . </s>
<s> One of the interactions in the book is that you &apos;re sent off on this quest where you need to go outside , take out your camera on the iPad and collect pictures of different natural objects . </s> ||| <s> Một trong những hoạt động tương tác trong quyển sách là bạn được cử đi một chuyến hành trình tìm kiếm trong đó bạn phải đi ra ngoài dùng máy ảnh của iPad và chụp ảnh của các vật thể tự nhiên khác nhau . </s>
<s> When I was a child , I had multiple collections of sticks and stones and <unk> and shells . </s> ||| <s> Khi còn nhỏ , tôi có hàng loạt bộ sưu tập que , đá , sỏi và vỏ sò . </s>
<s> And somehow kids don &apos;t do that anymore . </s> ||| <s> Và vì sao đó , ngày nay trẻ em không sưu tập nữa . </s>
<s> So in bringing back this childhood ritual , you need to go out and , in one chapter , take a picture of a flower and then tag it . </s> ||| <s> Thế nên , trong việc khơi trở lại nghi thức trẻ thơ này , bạn phải ra ngoài , và , trong một chương , chụp ảnh một bông hoa và ghi chú tên nó . </s>
<s> In another chapter , you need to take a picture of a piece of bark and then tag that . </s> ||| <s> Trong một chương khác , bạn phải chụp ảnh một mảnh vỏ cây và ghi chú tên nó . </s>
<s> And what happens is that you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can then put up online . </s> ||| <s> Và điều xảy ra là bạn sẽ tạo ra một bộ sưu tập ảnh kĩ thuật số mà bạn có thể trưng lên mạng . </s>
<s> A child in London puts up a picture of a <unk> and says , &quot; Oh , I saw a <unk> today . &quot; </s> ||| <s> Một em bé London trưng ảnh một chú cáo và nói rằng , &quot; Ồ , hôm nay tớ thấy con cáo . &quot; </s>
<s> A child in India says , &quot; I saw a monkey today . &quot; </s> ||| <s> Một em bé Ấn Độ nói , &quot; Hôm nay tớ thấy con khỉ . &quot; </s>
<s> And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photographs that you &apos;ve actually taken . </s> ||| <s> Và điều đó tạo nên một loại mạng xã hội quanh bộ sưu tập ảnh kĩ thuật số mà bạn chụp được . </s>
<s> In the possibilities of linking together magic , the earth and technology , there are multiple possibilities . </s> ||| <s> Trong khả năng kết nối lại phép màu , trái đất và công nghệ , còn rất nhiều khả năng khác nữa . </s>
<s> In the next book , we plan on having an interaction where you take your iPad out with the video on and through augmented reality , you see this layer of animated <unk> appear on a <unk> that &apos;s outside your house . </s> ||| <s> Trong quyển sách tiếp theo , chúng tôi dự định có một hoạt động tương tác mà bạn rút iPad ra với chế độ video bật và qua công nghệ hiện thực mở rộng , bạn thấy tầng yêu tinh động này xuất hiện trên một cây cảnh bên ngoài nhà bạn . </s>
<s> At one point , your screen is filled up with leaves . </s> ||| <s> Vào một thời điểm , màn hình của bạn đầy lá . </s>
<s> And so you need to make the sound of wind and blow them away and read the rest of the book . </s> ||| <s> Và thế là bạn phải tạo ra tiếng gió và thổi lá đi và đọc phần còn lại của sách . </s>
<s> We &apos;re moving , we &apos;re all moving here , to a world where the forces of nature come closer together to technology , and magic and technology can come closer together . </s> ||| <s> Chúng ta đang tiến tới , tất cả chúng ta đang tiến tới một thế giới nơi mà các sức mạnh tự nhiên đến gần hơn với công nghệ , và phép màu và công nghệ có thể tiến gần nhau hơn . </s>
<s> We &apos;re harnessing energy from the sun . </s> ||| <s> Ta đang khai thác năng lượng mặt trời . </s>
<s> We &apos;re bringing our children and ourselves closer to the natural world and that magic and joy and childhood love that we had through the simple medium of a story . </s> ||| <s> Chúng ta đang đưa con em ta và chính chúng ta lại gần hơn với thế giới tự nhiên và cái phép màu và niềm vui và <unk> yêu mến trẻ thơ ta có qua phương tiện đơn giản là một câu chuyện . </s>
<s> Thank you . </s> ||| <s> Xin cám ơn các bạn . </s>
<s> Because I usually take the role of trying to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along are going to be , and I thought that , since I was among friends here , I would tell you what I really think and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here with these amazing jumps in technology that seem so fast that we can barely keep on top of it . </s> ||| <s> Bởi tôi thường là người cố gắng giải thích cho mọi người hiểu những công nghệ mới sắp ra đời sẽ tuyệt vời như thế nào , và tôi nghĩ rằng , vì tôi từng ở trong số các bạn có mặt tại đây , tôi sẽ cho các bạn biết suy nghĩ của mình và cố gắng nhìn lại và cố gắng hiểu điều gì đang thực sự diễn ra với những bước nhảy vọt đáng kinh ngạc trong khoa học kỹ thuật dường như quá nhanh khiến chúng ta không thể nắm bắt kịp . </s>
<s> So I &apos;m going to start out by showing just one very boring technology slide . </s> ||| <s> Tôi sẽ bắt đầu bằng cách đưa ra một trang báo cáo nhàm chán về khoa học kỹ thuật . </s>
<s> And then , so if you can just turn on the slide that &apos;s on . </s> ||| <s> Tiếp theo , nếu bạn có thể bật trang báo cáo này lên . </s>
<s> This is just a random slide that I picked out of my file . </s> ||| <s> Đây chỉ là một trang báo cáo ngẫu nhiên mà tôi chọn ra từ trong tài liệu của tôi . </s>
<s> What I want to show you is not so much the details of the slide , but the general form of it . </s> ||| <s> Cái mà tôi muốn chỉ cho mọi người thấy không phải là những chi tiết của trang báo cáo mà là cái mẫu chung của nó . </s>
<s> This happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> microprocessors versus the power of local area networks . </s> ||| <s> Đây là một trang báo cáo về bản phân tích chúng tôi đang thực hiện so sánh giữa sức mạnh của bộ vi xử lý <unk> với sức mạnh của mạng cục bộ . </s>
<s> And the interesting thing about it is that this slide , like so many technology slides that we &apos;re used to , is a sort of a straight line on a <unk> curve . </s> ||| <s> Và điều thú vị là trang báo cáo này , giống như rất nhiều trang báo cáo công nghệ khác quen thuộc với chúng ta , là một loại đường thẳng nằm trên một bán đường cong <unk> </s>
<s> In other words , every step here represents an order of magnitude in performance scale . </s> ||| <s> Nói cách khác , mỗi bậc ở đây tượng trưng cho một mức độ trong thang biểu diễn . </s>
<s> And this is a new thing that we talk about technology on <unk> curves . </s> ||| <s> Và đây là một điều mới chúng ta nhắc đến về bán đường cong <unk> . </s>
<s> Something really weird is going on here . </s> ||| <s> Có cái gì đó kỳ quặc ở đây . </s>
<s> And that &apos;s basically what I &apos;m going to be talking about . </s> ||| <s> Và đó cơ bản là cái tôi muốn nói tới . </s>
<s> So , if you could bring up the lights . </s> ||| <s> Giờ , nếu bạn có thể chỉnh đèn cao hơn . </s>
<s> If you could bring up the lights higher , because I &apos;m just going to use a piece of paper here . </s> ||| <s> Nếu bạn có thể chỉnh đèn cao hơn chút nữa , vì tôi cần dùng mẩu giấy ở đây . </s>
<s> Now why do we draw technology curves in <unk> curves ? </s> ||| <s> Tại sao chúng ta phải vẽ đường cong kỹ thuật theo những bán đường xong <unk> ? </s>
<s> Well the answer is , if I drew it on a normal curve where , let &apos;s say , this is years , this is time of some sort , and this is whatever measure of the technology that I &apos;m trying to graph , the graphs look sort of silly . </s> ||| <s> Câu trả lời là , nếu tôi vẽ nó trên một đường cong bình thường đây , có thể nói , là năm , đây là một loại thời gian , và bất kể đây là thước đo công nghệ gì tôi đang cố gắng minh hoạ , đồ thị đều trông rất ngớ ngẩn . </s>
<s> They sort of go like this . </s> ||| <s> Chúng dường như chuyển động như thế này </s>
<s> And they don &apos;t tell us much . </s> ||| <s> và chúng không cho chúng ta biết nhiều lắm . </s>
<s> Now if I graph , for instance , some other technology , say transportation technology , on a <unk> curve , it would look very stupid , it would look like a flat line . </s> ||| <s> Giờ nếu tôi vẽ đồ thị , ví dụ , công nghệ khác , có thể là công nghệ vận tải , trên một bán đường cong <unk> , nó trông sẽ rất vô lý , giống như một đường thẳng . </s>
<s> But when something like this happens , things are <unk> changing . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng khi điều này xảy ra , mọi thứ thay đổi một cách định tính . </s>
<s> So if transportation technology was moving along as fast as microprocessor technology , then the day after tomorrow , I would be able to get in a taxi cab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds . </s> ||| <s> Vậy , nếu công nghệ vận tải phát triển nhanh như công nghệ vi xử lý , thì ngày kia tôi có thể gọi một chiếc taxi và đến Tokyo trong vòng 30 giây . </s>
<s> It &apos;s not moving like that . </s> ||| <s> Nó không phải như vậy . </s>
<s> And there &apos;s nothing <unk> in the history of technology development of this kind of <unk> growth where you go by orders of magnitude every few years . </s> ||| <s> Và không có tiền lệ trong lịch sử phát triển công nghệ về sự tự tăng tiến bằng cách thay đổi cường độ vài năm một . </s>
<s> Now the question that I &apos;d like to ask is , if you look at these exponential curves , they don &apos;t go on forever . </s> ||| <s> Giờ câu hỏi tôi muốn đặt ra là , nếu bạn nhìn vào những đường cong theo quy luật số mũ này , chúng không nhân lên mãi mãi . </s>
<s> Things just can &apos;t possibly keep changing as fast as they are . </s> ||| <s> Mọi thứ không thể mãi thay đổi nhanh chóng như chúng đang diễn ra . </s>
<s> One of two things is going to happen . </s> ||| <s> Một trong hai việc sẽ xảy ra . </s>
<s> Either it &apos;s going to turn into a sort of classical <unk> like this , until something totally different comes along , or maybe it &apos;s going to do this . </s> ||| <s> Hoặc nó sẽ biến thành một dạng đường cong S như thế này , cho tới khi một việc gì đó khác biệt hoàn toàn xảy ra , hoặc có thể , nó sẽ chuyển thành thế này . </s>
<s> That &apos;s about all it can do . </s> ||| <s> Đó là tất cả những gì có thể xảy ra . </s>
<s> Now I &apos;m an optimist , so I sort of think it &apos;s probably going to do something like that . </s> ||| <s> Hiện giờ , tôi đang lạc quan , vì vậy , tôi nghĩ rằng nó có thể đi theo cách này . </s>
<s> If so , that means that what we &apos;re in the middle of right now is a transition . </s> ||| <s> Nếu đúng như vậy , nó có nghĩa là chúng ta đang ở giữa giai đoạn của sự chuyển giao . </s>
<s> We &apos;re sort of on this line in a transition from the way the world used to be to some new way that the world is . </s> ||| <s> Chúng ta đang ở trên đường thẳng này trong quá trình chuyển giao giữa trạng thái thế giới từng tồn tại tới trạng thái mới mà thế giới đang tồn tại . </s>
<s> And so what I &apos;m trying to ask , what I &apos;ve been asking myself , is what &apos;s this new way that the world is ? </s> ||| <s> Và vì vậy , điều mà tôi đang muốn hỏi , điều mà tôi vẫn đang tự hỏi mình , là trạng thái mới mà thế giới đang tồn tại là gì ? </s>
<s> What &apos;s that new state that the world is heading toward ? </s> ||| <s> <unk> thái mới mà thế giới đang hướng tới là gì ? </s>
<s> Because the transition seems very , very confusing when we &apos;re right in the middle of it . </s> ||| <s> Bởi vì quá trình chuyển giao này có vẻ rất khó đoán biết khi chúng ta đang ở ngay giữa của quá trình ấy . </s>
<s> Now when I was a kid growing up , the future was kind of the year 2000 , and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000 . </s> ||| <s> Khi tôi là một đứa trẻ đang lớn lên , tương lai đối với tôi là năm 2000 , và mọi người thường đoán trước việc gì sẽ xảy ra vào năm 2000 . </s>
<s> Now here &apos;s a conference in which people talk about the future , and you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000 . </s> ||| <s> Đây là một hội nghị mà ở đó mọi người bàn về tương lai , và mọi người có thể nhận thấy tương lai đó vẫn xoay quanh năm 2000 . </s>
<s> It &apos;s about as far as we go out . </s> ||| <s> Nó ở xa cách khi chúng ta tiến tới nó . </s>
<s> So in other words , the future has kind of been shrinking one year per year for my whole lifetime . </s> ||| <s> Vì vậy , nói cách khác , tương lai dường như chùn lại một năm mỗi năm cho cả đời người . </s>
<s> Now I think that the reason is because we all feel that something &apos;s happening there . </s> ||| <s> Tôi nghĩ rằng lí do của việc ấy là bởi tất cả chúng ta đều cảm thấy việc gì đó đang diễn ra tại thời điểm ấy . </s>
<s> That transition is happening . We can all sense it . </s> ||| <s> Sự chuyển giao ấy đang diễn ra . Chúng ta đều có thể cảm nhận được nó . </s>
<s> And we know that it just doesn &apos;t make too much sense to think out 30 , 50 years because everything &apos;s going to be so different that a simple <unk> of what we &apos;re doing just doesn &apos;t make any sense at all . </s> ||| <s> Và chúng ta biết rằng nó không có ý nghĩa lắm khi nghĩ về 30 , 50 năm sau vì khi ấy tất cả mọi thứ sẽ trở nên rất khác biệt khiến một phép ngoại suy rất đơn giản mà chúng ta thực hiện hôm nay sẽ không có ý nghĩa gì trong thời điểm ấy . </s>
<s> So what I would like to talk about is what that could be , what that transition could be that we &apos;re going through . </s> ||| <s> Vì vậy , cái mà tôi muốn nói đến là điều có thể , là sự chuyển giao có thể chính là giai đoạn chúng ta đang trải qua . </s>
<s> Now in order to do that I &apos;m going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and computers . </s> ||| <s> Để làm được điều đó tôi sẽ nói về một đống thứ thực sự không có gì liên quan đến công nghệ và máy tính . </s>
<s> Because I think the only way to understand this is to really step back and take a long time scale look at things . </s> ||| <s> Bởi vì tôi nghĩ rằng cách duy nhất để hiểu được điều này là thực sự đặt mình vào trong quá khứ và dành một cái nhìn lâu dài vào mọi vật . </s>
<s> So the time scale that I would like to look at this on is the time scale of life on Earth . </s> ||| <s> <unk> cân thời gian mà tôi muốn nhìn vào là cán cân thời gian của sự sống trên Trái Đất . </s>
<s> So I think this picture makes sense if you look at it a few billion years at a time . </s> ||| <s> Và do đó , tôi nghĩ bức ảnh này có ý nghĩa của nó nếu mọi người nhìn vào nó với góc độ vài tỉ năm . </s>
<s> So if you go back about two and a half billion years , the Earth was this big , sterile <unk> of rock with a lot of chemicals floating around on it . </s> ||| <s> Nếu mọi người quay trở lại trước đây 2,5 tỉ năm , Trái Đất từng to như thế này , với những khúc đá cằn cỗi cùng rất nhiều tạp chất hoá học nổi xung quanh nó . </s>
<s> And if you look at the way that the chemicals got organized , we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it . </s> ||| <s> Và nếu mọi người nhìn vào cách các chất hoá học ấy được hình thành , chúng ta sẽ bắt đầu hiểu được chúng hình thành như thế nào . </s>
<s> And I think that there &apos;s theories that are beginning to understand about how it started with RNA , but I &apos;m going to tell a sort of simple story of it , which is that , at that time , there were little drops of oil floating around with all kinds of different recipes of chemicals in them . </s> ||| <s> Và tôi nghĩ có những giải thuyết đang dần giải thích được cách nó bắt đầu với ARN , nhưng tôi sẽ kể một câu chuyện đơn giản về nó , câu chuyện mà , vào thời điểm đó , có những giọt dầu nhỏ xíu trôi nổi xung quanh với vô vàn công thức hoá học bên trong nó . </s>
<s> And some of those drops of oil had a particular combination of chemicals in them which caused them to incorporate chemicals from the outside and grow the drops of oil . </s> ||| <s> Và một số giọt dầu ấy có sự kết hợp đặc biệt giữa các chất hoá học trong thành phần của nó khiến chúng liên kết với những chất hoá học bên ngoài và làm những giọt dầu lớn lên . </s>
<s> And those that were like that started to split and divide . </s> ||| <s> Và những giọt dầu như thế bắt đầu tách ra và phân chia . </s>
<s> And those were the most primitive forms of cells in a sense , those little drops of oil . </s> ||| <s> Và chúng là những mẫu hình tế bào nguyên thuỷ nhất , những giọt dầu nhỏ đó . </s>
<s> But now those drops of oil weren &apos;t really alive , as we say it now , because every one of them was a little random recipe of chemicals . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng ngày nay những giọt dầu ấy không thực sự tồn tại , như chúng ta nói đến hiện giờ , bởi tất cả chúng đều là công thức ngẫu nhiên của nhiều chất hoá học . </s>
<s> And every time it divided , they got sort of unequal division of the chemicals within them . </s> ||| <s> Và tất cả mọi lần nó phân chia , chúng đều phân chia không đều những thành phần hoá học trong chúng . </s>
<s> And so every drop was a little bit different . </s> ||| <s> Và vì vậy , tất cả các giọt đều khác nhau đôi chút . </s>
<s> In fact , the drops that were different in a way that caused them to be better at incorporating chemicals around them , grew more and incorporated more chemicals and divided more . </s> ||| <s> Trên thực tế , các giọt khác nhau theo cách khiến chúng có khả năng liên kết tốt hơn với chất hoá học xung quanh chúng , phát triển nhanh hơn , liên kết nhạy hơn và phân chia nhiều hơn . </s>
<s> So those tended to live longer , get expressed more . </s> ||| <s> Vì vậy , những giọt có xu hướng tồn tại lâu hơn được thể hiện ra nhiều hơn . </s>
<s> Now that &apos;s sort of just a very simple chemical form of life , but when things got interesting was when these drops learned a trick about abstraction . </s> ||| <s> Đó chỉ là một dạng hoá học cơ bản của sự sống , nhưng mọi thứ thú vị hơn khi những giọt ấy học được mẹo để chiết ra . </s>
<s> Somehow by ways that we don &apos;t quite understand , these little drops learned to write down information . </s> ||| <s> Bằng cách nào đó mà chúng ta không hiểu được , những giọt nhỏ ấy học cách để lại thông tin . </s>
<s> They learned to record the information that was the recipe of the cell onto a particular kind of chemical called DNA . </s> ||| <s> Chúng học cách lưu trữ thông tin những thông tin ấy chính là công thức hoá học của tế bào vào một chất hoá học đặc trưng gọi là ADN . </s>
<s> So in other words , they worked out , in this mindless sort of evolutionary way , a form of writing that let them write down what they were , so that that way of writing it down could get copied . </s> ||| <s> Nói cách khác , chúng hình thành , dưới dạng tiến hoá không ý thức , một mẫu viết cho phép chúng ghi lại chúng cấu tạo như thế nào , để từ đó chúng có thể sao chép . </s>
<s> The amazing thing is that that way of writing seems to have stayed steady since it evolved two and a half billion years ago . </s> ||| <s> Điều đáng ngạc nhiên là cách lưu trữ thông tin ấy có vẻ rất ổn định vì nó đã tiến hoá từ 2,5 tỉ năm trước . </s>
<s> In fact the recipe for us , our genes , is exactly that same code and that same way of writing . </s> ||| <s> Thực tế , gen của chúng ta , có quy tắc giống hệt và có cách lưu trữ giống hệt như vậy . </s>
<s> In fact , every living creature is written in exactly the same set of letters and the same code . </s> ||| <s> Thực tế , mọi sinh vật sống đều được lưu trữ cấu tạo gen của nó bằng hệ thống kí tự và mật mã hoàn toàn tương tự . </s>
<s> In fact , one of the things that I did just for amusement purposes is we can now write things in this code . </s> ||| <s> Thực tế , một trong những điều tôi đã làm để tiêu khiển là chúng ta giờ có thể lưu trữ nhiều thứ bằng mật mã này . </s>
<s> And I &apos;ve got here a little 100 <unk> of white powder , which I try not to let the security people see at airports . </s> ||| <s> Tôi có ở đây 100 <unk> bột trắng , thứ mà tôi thường phải cố gắng giấu nhân viên bảo vệ ở sân bay . </s>
<s> But this has in it -- what I did is I took this code -- the code has standard letters that we use for <unk> it -- and I wrote my business card onto a piece of DNA and <unk> it 10 to the 22 times . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng trong nó -- điều mà tôi làm là tôi hình thành nên mật mã này -- mật mã có những kí tự tiêu chuẩn chúng ta dùng để tượng trưng hoá nó -- và tôi viết thẻ kinh doanh của tôi trên một mẩu ADN và khuếch đại nó lên 10 đến 22 lần . </s>
<s> So if anyone would like a hundred million copies of my business card , I have plenty for everyone in the room , and , in fact , everyone in the world , and it &apos;s right here . </s> ||| <s> Nếu có ai đó thích hàng trăm triệu bản sao chép thẻ kinh doanh của tôi , tôi có thể đưa mọi người trong căn phòng này rất nhiều bản , và , trên thực tế , tất cả mọi người trên thế giới , và nó đang ở ngay đây . </s>
<s> If I had really been a <unk> , I would have put it into a virus and released it in the room . </s> ||| <s> Nếu như tôi là một kẻ tự tôn tự phụ , tôi có thể đã biến nó thành một loại vi-rút và thả nó vào căn phòng này . </s>
<s> So what was the next step ? </s> ||| <s> Vậy bước tiếp theo là gì ? </s>
<s> <unk> down the DNA was an interesting step . </s> ||| <s> Thiết lập một cấu trúc ADN là một bước thú vị . </s>
<s> And that caused these cells -- that kept them happy for another billion years . </s> ||| <s> Và nó tạo nên những tế bào này -- làm những tế bào này tồn tại thêm 1 tỉ năm nữa . </s>
<s> But then there was another really interesting step where things became completely different , which is these cells started exchanging and communicating information , so that they began to get communities of cells . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng tiếp sau đó , có một giai đoạn khác cũng rất thú vị khi mọi thứ trở nên hoàn toàn khác biệt , đó là lúc những tế bào này bắt đầu trao đổi và giao tiếp thông tin , và hình thành nên cộng đồng tế bào . </s>
<s> I don &apos;t know if you know this , but bacteria can actually exchange DNA . </s> ||| <s> Tôi không biết nếu các bạn biết điều này , nhưng vi khuẩn có thể thực sự trao đổi ADN . </s>
<s> Now that &apos;s why , for instance , antibiotic resistance has evolved . </s> ||| <s> Bởi vì vậy mà , ví dụ , sự kháng thuốc kháng sinh được hình thành . </s>
<s> Some bacteria figured out how to stay away from penicillin , and it went around sort of creating its little DNA information with other bacteria , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin , because bacteria communicate . </s> ||| <s> Một số loại vi khuẩn tìm ra cách kháng thuốc penicillin , và nó lan toả ra xung quanh trao đổi thông tin ADN của chúng với các vi khuẩn khác , và ngày nay chúng ta có rất nhiều loại vi khuẩn có khả năng kháng lại penicillin , bởi vì vi khuẩn truyền đạt thông tin ADN . </s>
<s> Now what this communication allowed was communities to form that , in some sense , were in the same boat together ; they were <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Việc truyền đạt này cho phép các cộng đồng vi khuẩn có thể hình thành mà trong đó bao gồm những loại vi khuẩn cùng cảnh ngộ ; chúng hợp tác với nhau . </s>
<s> So they survived or they failed together , which means that if a community was very successful , all the individuals in that community were repeated more and they were favored by evolution . </s> ||| <s> Và vì vậy , chúng cùng sống sót hay cùng chết dần , điều đó cũng có nghĩa là , nếu một cộng đồng phát triển tốt , tất cả cá nhân trong cộng đồng ấy lại tự sản sinh ra thêm nhiều cá thể và chúng tiến hoá theo hướng tích cực . </s>
<s> Now the transition point happened when these communities got so close that , in fact , they got together and decided to write down the whole recipe for the community together on one string of DNA . </s> ||| <s> Thời điểm chuyển giao xảy ra khi những cộng đồng ấy gần gũi với nhau đến mức , trong thực tế , chúng cùng nhau hình thành nên một công thức cấu tạo chung cho cả quần thể trên một dãy ADN duy nhất . </s>
<s> And so the next stage that &apos;s interesting in life took about another billion years . </s> ||| <s> Và vì vậy , quá trình tiếp theo rất thú vị trong sự sống mất khoảng 1 tỉ năm nữa . </s>
<s> And at that stage , we have <unk> communities , communities of lots of different types of cells , working together as a single organism . </s> ||| <s> Và vào thời điểm ấy , chúng ta có quần thể đa tế bào , quần thể có vô số loại tế bào khác nhau , làm việc cùng nhau như một cơ quan duy nhất . </s>
<s> And in fact , we &apos;re such a <unk> community . </s> ||| <s> Và trong thực tế , chúng ta chính là một quần thể đa tế bào . </s>
<s> We have lots of cells that are not out for themselves anymore . </s> ||| <s> Chúng ta có rất nhiều tế bào mà chúng không thể tồn tại một cách riêng rẽ . </s>
<s> Your skin cell is really useless without a heart cell , muscle cell , a brain cell and so on . </s> ||| <s> Tế bào da của mọi người sẽ không có tác dụng gì nếu thiếu sự tồn tại của thế bào tim , tế bào cơ , tế bào não và rất nhiều tế bào khác . </s>
<s> So these communities began to evolve so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place was no longer a cell , but a community which we call an organism . </s> ||| <s> Do đó , những quần thể này bắt đầu tiến hoá khiến mức độ thú vị mà tiến hoá xảy ra không còn là trên một tế bào , mà trên một quần thể chúng ta gọi là cơ thể sống . </s>
<s> Now the next step that happened is within these communities . </s> ||| <s> Quá trình tiếp theo xảy ra là ở trong những quần thể này . </s>
<s> These communities of cells , again , began to abstract information . </s> ||| <s> Những quần thể tế bào này , một lần nữa , bắt đầu chiết ra thông tin . </s>
<s> And they began building very special structures that did nothing but process information within the community . </s> ||| <s> Và chúng bắt đầu hình thành nên những cấu hình đặc biệt có tác dụng không gì khác ngoài việc xử lí thông tin trong quần thể . </s>
<s> And those are the neural structures . </s> ||| <s> Và đó là những cấu trúc thần kinh . </s>
<s> So neurons are the information processing apparatus that those communities of cells built up . </s> ||| <s> Tế bào thần kinh là bộ máy xử lí thông tin mà quần thể tế bào cấu tạo nên . </s>
<s> And in fact , they began to get specialists in the community and special structures that were responsible for recording , understanding , learning information . </s> ||| <s> Và trên thực tế , chúng được phân hoá trong quần thể và những cấu trúc đặc biệt chịu trách nhiệm cho việc ghi chép , đọc hiểu , xử lí thông tin . </s>
<s> And that was the brains and the nervous system of those communities . </s> ||| <s> Và đó là bộ não và hệ thống thần kinh của những quần thể ấy . </s>
<s> And that gave them an evolutionary advantage . </s> ||| <s> Và chúng đem đến sự thuận lợi trong quá trình tiến hoá . </s>
<s> Because at that point , an individual -- learning could happen within the time span of a single organism , instead of over this evolutionary time span . </s> ||| <s> Bởi vì ở thời điểm ấy , một cá thể -- việc xử lí thông tin có thể xảy ra trong khoảng thời gian tồn tại của một cá thể sống , thay vì trong khoảng thời gian tiến hoá này . </s>
<s> So an organism could , for instance , learn not to eat a certain kind of fruit because it tasted bad and it got sick last time it ate it . </s> ||| <s> Vì vậy một cá thể sống có thể , ví dụ , học được việc không ăn một loại quả nào đó bởi vì nó có vị không ngon và cá thể đó thấy khó chịu khi ăn loại quả đó . </s>
<s> That could happen within the lifetime of a single organism , whereas before they &apos;d built these special information processing structures , that would have had to be learned evolutionarily over hundreds of thousands of years by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fruit . </s> ||| <s> Việc này có thể xảy ra trong suốt thời gian tồn tại của một cơ thể sống , trong khi trước lúc chúng hình thành nên cấu trúc xử lí thông tin đặc biệt này , việc đó có thể đã được học trong quá trình tiến hoá trên trăm ngàn năm nhờ những cá thể chết vì ăn phải loại quả đó . </s>
<s> So that nervous system , the fact that they built these special information structures , tremendously sped up the whole process of evolution . </s> ||| <s> Hệ thống thần kinh đó , sự thật là chúng hình thành nên những cấu trúc thông tin đặc biệt ấy , đã nhanh chóng thúc đẩy cả quá trình tiến hoá . </s>
<s> Because evolution could now happen within an individual . </s> ||| <s> Bởi quá trình tiến hoá ngày nay có thể xảy ra bên trong một cá thể . </s>
<s> It could happen in learning time scales . </s> ||| <s> Nó có thể xảy ra trong thời gian xử lí thông tin . </s>
<s> But then what happened was the individuals worked out , of course , tricks of communicating . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng sau đó điều xảy ra là các cá thể hình thành nên đương nhiên rồi , những mánh khoé trong việc trao đổi thông tin . </s>
<s> And for example , the most sophisticated version that we &apos;re aware of is human language . </s> ||| <s> Ví dụ như , phiên bản phức tạp nhất chúng ta biết đến là ngôn ngữ của loài người . </s>
<s> It &apos;s really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it . </s> ||| <s> Nếu bạn nghĩ về nó , bạn sẽ thấy đó là một phát minh hết sức vĩ đại . </s>
<s> Here I have a very complicated , messy , confused idea in my head . </s> ||| <s> Tôi có một suy nghĩ hết sức phức tạp , hỗn độn , và mơ hồ trong tâm trí . </s>
<s> I &apos;m sitting here making <unk> sounds basically , and hopefully constructing a similar messy , confused idea in your head that bears some analogy to it . </s> ||| <s> Tôi đang ngồi đây nói ra những tiếng lẩm bẩm , hy vọng tạo ra trong đầu mọi người một suy nghĩ cũng hỗn độn và mơ hồ và có đôi chút tương tự như suy nghĩ của tôi . </s>
<s> But we &apos;re taking something very complicated , turning it into sound , sequences of sounds , and producing something very complicated in your brain . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng chúng ta đang lấy một thứ rất phức tạp , biến nó thành những tiếng , một dãy các loại tiếng , và hình thành nên trong não mọi người một suy nghĩ phức tạp . </s>
<s> So this allows us now to begin to start functioning as a single organism . </s> ||| <s> Việc này cho phép chúng ta bắt đầu tồn tại như một cơ thể sống . </s>
<s> And so , in fact , what we &apos;ve done is we , humanity , have started <unk> out . </s> ||| <s> Và trên thực tế , điều chúng ta đã thực hiện là loài người chúng ta , bắt đầu biết chọn lọc . </s>
<s> We &apos;re going through the same levels that <unk> organisms have gone through -- <unk> out our methods of recording , presenting , processing information . </s> ||| <s> Chúng ta đang trải qua các quá trình tương tự như các cá thể sống đa tế bào đã , đang trải qua -- chọn lọc phương pháp sao chép , biểu hiện , xử lí thông tin . </s>
<s> So for example , the invention of language was a tiny step in that direction . </s> ||| <s> Ví dụ như , sự phát minh ra tiếng nói là một bước tiến nhỏ theo chiều hướng ấy . </s>
<s> <unk> , computers , <unk> , <unk> and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we &apos;ve now built within our society for handling that information . </s> ||| <s> Điện thoại , máy tính , băng video , đĩa CD và nhiều thứ khác là những thiết bị chuyên dụng mà chúng ta tạo ra trong xã hội để làm việc với thông tin . </s>
<s> And it all connects us together into something that is much bigger and much faster and able to evolve than what we were before . </s> ||| <s> Và chúng đều liên kết chúng ta thành một cộng đồng lớn hơn nhanh hơn và có khả năng tiến hoá xa hơn chúng ta trước đây . </s>
<s> So now , evolution can take place on a scale of microseconds . </s> ||| <s> Vậy giờ đây , tiến hoá có thể xảy ra trong thời khắc vài phần giây . </s>
<s> And you saw <unk> &apos;s little evolutionary example where he sort of did a little bit of evolution on the <unk> program right before your eyes . </s> ||| <s> Mọi người đã xem ví dụ nhỏ của <unk> về tiến hoá khi ông ấy đã thúc đẩy tiến hoá trên chương trình <unk> <unk> ngay trước mắt mọi người . </s>
<s> So now we &apos;ve <unk> up the time scales once again . </s> ||| <s> Giờ chúng ta đã tăng tốc khung thời gian lên một lần nữa . </s>
<s> So the first steps of the story that I told you about took a billion years a piece . </s> ||| <s> Vì vậy những bước đầu tiên của câu chuyện tôi kể cho mọi người xảy ra trong 1 tỉ năm . </s>
<s> And the next steps , like nervous systems and brains , took a few hundred million years . </s> ||| <s> Và những giai đoạn tiếp theo , như hệ thống thần kinh và não bộ , mất vài trăm triệu năm . </s>
<s> Then the next steps , like language and so on , took less than a million years . </s> ||| <s> Quá trình tiếp theo , như ngôn ngữ và những thứ tương tự , xảy ra trong vòng ít hơn một triệu năm . </s>
<s> And these next steps , like electronics , seem to be taking only a few decades . </s> ||| <s> Và những quá trình tiếp theo , như điện , dường như chỉ mất có một vài thập kỷ . </s>
<s> The process is feeding on itself and becoming , I guess , <unk> is the word for it -- when something reinforces its rate of change . </s> ||| <s> Quá trình này cứ tự nó tiếp diễn và trở nên , tôi đoán rằng , tự xúc tác là từ thích hợp -- khi một quá trình tự thúc đẩy tốc độ thay đổi của nó . </s>
<s> The more it changes , the faster it changes . </s> ||| <s> Quá trình thay đổi càng nhiều , tốc độ nó thay đổi càng nhanh . </s>
<s> And I think that that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explosion of curve . </s> ||| <s> Và tôi nghĩ rằng đó là thứ mà chúng ta đang thấy ở đây , trong sự bùng nổ của đường cong này . </s>
<s> We &apos;re seeing this process feeding back on itself . </s> ||| <s> Chúng ta đang thấy quá trình này tự thúc đẩy bản thân nó . </s>
<s> Now I design computers for a living , and I know that the mechanisms that I use to design computers would be impossible without recent advances in computers . </s> ||| <s> Giờ tôi thiết kế máy tính để kiếm tiền , và tôi biết rằng thiết bị tôi dùng để thiết kế máy tính có thể không sử dụng được nếu không có những công nghệ gần đây trong ngành máy tính . </s>
<s> So right now , what I do is I design objects at such complexity that it &apos;s really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense . </s> ||| <s> Vì vậy , bây giờ , điều tôi làm là thiết kế vật dụng với mức độ phức tạp dường như bất khả thi nếu thiết kế chúng theo hướng truyền thống . </s>
<s> I don &apos;t know what every transistor in the connection machine does . </s> ||| <s> Tôi không biết công dụng của tất cả các bóng bán dẫn trong máy kết nối . </s>
<s> There are billions of them . </s> ||| <s> Bởi có hàng tỉ bóng bán dẫn . </s>
<s> Instead , what I do and what the designers at Thinking <unk> do is we think at some level of abstraction and then we hand it to the machine and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do , much farther and faster than we could ever do . </s> ||| <s> Thay vào đó , thứ tôi thực hiện cũng như thứ mà các thiết kế viên đang thực hiện tại Tập đoàn Các Thiết Bị Có Suy Nghĩ đó là chúng tôi suy nghĩ về mức độ của sự chiết lọc và đưa cái chiết lọc đó vào trong máy móc và máy móc đó sử dụng sự chiết lọc hiệu quả hơn chúng tôi có thể làm , tiến xa hơn và nhanh hơn chúng tôi có thể . </s>
<s> And in fact , sometimes it takes it by methods that we don &apos;t quite even understand . </s> ||| <s> Và trên thực tế , đôi khi chúng thực hiện bởi những phương pháp chúng tôi thậm chí không hiểu rõ lắm . </s>
<s> One method that &apos;s particularly interesting that I &apos;ve been using a lot lately is evolution itself . </s> ||| <s> Một phương pháp đặc biệt thú vị mà tôi hiện vẫn đang dùng nhiều là bản thân sự tiến hoá </s>
<s> So what we do is we put inside the machine a process of evolution that takes place on the <unk> time scale . </s> ||| <s> Điều mà chúng tôi làm là đặt vào trong máy một quy trình phát triển xảy ra trong khung thời gian giây cực nhỏ . </s>
<s> So for example , in the most extreme cases , we can actually evolve a program by starting out with random sequences of instructions . </s> ||| <s> Ví dụ như , trong những trường hợp đặc biệt , chúng ta có thể thực sự phát triển một chương trình bằng cách bắt đầu với những dãy câu lệnh . </s>
<s> Say , &quot; Computer , would you please make a hundred million random sequences of instructions . </s> ||| <s> Hay nói cách khác , &quot; Máy tính , liệu bạn có thể đưa ra hàng trăm triệu dãy câu lệnh ngẫu nhiên . </s>
<s> Now would you please run all of those random sequences of instructions , run all of those programs , and pick out the ones that came closest to doing what I wanted . &quot; </s> ||| <s> Giờ liệu bạn có thể thực hiện tất cả các dãy câu lệnh ngẫu nhiên đó , chạy tất cả các chương trình đó , và chọn ra những chương trình gần gũi nhất với việc mà tôi đang muốn thực hiện . &quot; </s>
<s> So in other words , I define what I wanted . </s> ||| <s> Nói cách khác , tôi xác định thứ tôi muốn . </s>
<s> Let &apos;s say I want to sort numbers , as a simple example I &apos;ve done it with . </s> ||| <s> Khi tôi muốn sắp xếp các số , một ví dụ đơn giản mà tôi thực hiện được . </s>
<s> So find the programs that come closest to <unk> numbers . </s> ||| <s> Và tìm chương trình gần gũi nhất với công việc sắp xếp con số . </s>
<s> So of course , random sequences of instructions are very unlikely to sort numbers , so none of them will really do it . </s> ||| <s> Và đương nhiên , dãy câu lệnh ngẫu nhiên sẽ không có xu hướng sắp xếp các con số , vì vậy , không một câu lệnh nào sẽ thực sự thực hiện nhiệm vụ ấy . </s>
<s> But one of them , by luck , may put two numbers in the right order . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng một trong số đó , nếu may mắn , sẽ đặt hai số vào đúng vị trí . </s>
<s> And I say , &quot; Computer , would you please now take the 10 percent of those random sequences that did the best job . </s> ||| <s> Và tôi nói , &quot; Máy tính , liệu bạn có thể chọn ra 10 % trong số dãy ngẫu nhiên đó mà thực hiện công việc tốt nhất . </s>
<s> Save those . <unk> off the rest . </s> ||| <s> Giữ chúng lại . Loại đi dãy còn lại . </s>
<s> And now let &apos;s reproduce the ones that sorted numbers the best . </s> ||| <s> Và tiếp theo hãy sao chép lại những dãy câu lệnh sắp xếp các con số tốt nhất . </s>
<s> And let &apos;s reproduce them by a process of <unk> analogous to sex . &quot; </s> ||| <s> Và hãy sao chép chúng bằng quá trình tái tổ hợp tương tự như sinh sản . &quot; </s>
<s> Take two programs and they produce children by exchanging their <unk> , and the children inherit the traits of the <unk> of the two programs . </s> ||| <s> Lấy ra hai chương trình và chúng sẽ tạo ra sản phẩm bằng cách trao đổi quy tắc ngầm của chúng , và sản phẩm được thừa hưởng tính chất của các quy tắc của hai chương trình . </s>
<s> So I &apos;ve got now a new generation of programs that are produced by combinations of the programs that did a little bit better job . </s> ||| <s> Tôi có hiện nay một thế hệ chương trình mới được sản xuất bởi sự kết hợp của các chương trình mà thực hiện công việc tốt hơn một chút . </s>
<s> Say , &quot; Please repeat that process . &quot; </s> ||| <s> Tôi nói với máy tính , &quot; Hãy lặp lại quá trình . &quot; </s>
<s> <unk> them again . </s> ||| <s> Đánh giá lại chúng một lần nữa . </s>
<s> <unk> some mutations perhaps . </s> ||| <s> Có thể đưa ra vài sự hoán đổi . </s>
<s> And try that again and do that for another generation . </s> ||| <s> Và thử lại lần nữa , thực hiện nó cho một thế hệ khác . </s>
<s> Well every one of those generations just takes a few milliseconds . </s> ||| <s> Tất cả mọi cá nhân trong thế hệ mới đều chỉ mất vài <unk> . </s>
<s> So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution on that within the computer in a few minutes , or in the complicated cases , in a few hours . </s> ||| <s> Và vì vậy , tôi có thể thực hiện sự tiến hoá tương tự của vài triệu năm trong một máy tính chỉ trong vài phút , hay nếu trong trường hợp phức tạp , một vài tiếng . </s>
<s> At the end of that , I end up with programs that are absolutely perfect at <unk> numbers . </s> ||| <s> Kết thúc quá trình , tôi sẽ có chương trình chắc chắn hoàn hảo với việc sắp xếp con số . </s>
<s> In fact , they are programs that are much more efficient than programs I could have ever written by hand . </s> ||| <s> Trên thực tế , chúng là chương trình hiệu quả hơn nhiều chương trình tôi có thể viết tay . </s>
<s> Now if I look at those programs , I can &apos;t tell you how they work . </s> ||| <s> Giờ nếu tôi nhìn vào những chương trình ấy , Tôi không thể cho mọi người biết chúng hoạt động như thế nào . </s>
<s> I &apos;ve tried looking at them and telling you how they work . </s> ||| <s> Tôi luôn cố gắng thăm dò chúng và chỉ cho bạn cách nó hoạt động . </s>
<s> They &apos;re obscure , weird programs . </s> ||| <s> Chúng là những chương trình rất mơ hồ và kì quặc . </s>
<s> But they do the job . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng chúng thực hiện được công việc . </s>
<s> And in fact , I know , I &apos;m very confident that they do the job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job . </s> ||| <s> Và trên thực tế , tôi biết , tôi rất tự tin rằng chúng thực hiện được công việc bởi vì chúng đến từ một loạt hàng trăm nghìn chương trình đã thực hiện được công việc đó . </s>
<s> In fact , their life depended on doing the job . </s> ||| <s> Trên thực tế , sự tồn tại của những chương trình ấy phụ thuộc vào cái công việc ấy . </s>
<s> I was riding in a 747 with Marvin Minsky once , and he pulls out this card and says , &quot; Oh look . Look at this . </s> ||| <s> Tôi từng một lần ngồi trong một chiếc 747 với Marvin <unk> , và anh ta lấy ra tấm thẻ và nói , &quot; Ôi nhìn kìa . Nhìn vào đây . </s>
<s> It says , &apos; This plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts working together to make you a safe flight . &apos; Doesn &apos;t that make you feel confident ? &quot; </s> ||| <s> Nó nói rằng , &apos; Chiếc máy bay này có trăm nghìn chi tiết cùng hoạt động để cho bạn có một chuyến bay an toàn . &apos; Nó không khiến bạn cảm thấy tự tin sao ? &quot; </s>
<s> In fact , we know that the engineering process doesn &apos;t work very well when it gets complicated . </s> ||| <s> Trên thực tế , chúng ta đều biết rằng quá trình thiết kế xây dựng không được thuận lợi khi nó quá phức tạp . </s>
<s> So we &apos;re beginning to depend on computers to do a process that &apos;s very different than engineering . </s> ||| <s> Vì vậy , chúng ta bắt đầu phụ thuộc vào máy tính để thực hiện một quá trình khác biệt hơn hẳn với thiết kế xây dựng . </s>
<s> And it lets us produce things of much more complexity than normal engineering lets us produce . </s> ||| <s> Và nó cho phép chúng ta sản xuất ra những sản phẩm phức tạp hơn nhiều so với thiết kế xây dựng bình thường cho phép . </s>
<s> And yet , we don &apos;t quite understand the options of it . </s> ||| <s> Vậy mà chúng ta vẫn không thực sự hiểu sự lựa chọn của nó . </s>
<s> So in a sense , it &apos;s getting ahead of us . </s> ||| <s> Và vì vậy , trong một góc nhìn , nó đang tiến trước chúng ta . </s>
<s> We &apos;re now using those programs to make much faster computers so that we &apos;ll be able to run this process much faster . </s> ||| <s> Chúng ta đang sử dụng những chương trình ấy để tạo ra máy tính nhanh hơn để từ đó chúng ta có thể thực hiện quá trình nhanh hơn . </s>
<s> So it &apos;s feeding back on itself . </s> ||| <s> Và vì vậy , nó đang thúc đẩy chính bản thân nó . </s>
<s> The thing is becoming faster and that &apos;s why I think it seems so confusing . </s> ||| <s> Điều này đang diễn ra ngày càng nhanh và đó là lí do tại sao tôi thấy nó khá mơ hồ . </s>
<s> Because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves . </s> ||| <s> Bởi tất cả công nghệ này đều tự thúc đẩy bản thân nó phát triển . </s>
<s> We &apos;re taking off . </s> ||| <s> Chúng ta đang cất cánh . </s>
<s> And what we are is we &apos;re at a point in time which is analogous to when <unk> organisms were turning into <unk> organisms . </s> ||| <s> Và chúng ta đang ở thời điểm trong quá trình mà tương tự như khi những cơ thể sống đơn bào chuyển sang cơ thể sống đa bào . </s>
<s> So we &apos;re the <unk> and we can &apos;t quite figure out what the hell this thing is we &apos;re creating . </s> ||| <s> Chúng ta là những trùng <unk> và chúng ta gần như không thể hiểu nổi thứ mà chúng ta đang chế tạo ra . </s>
<s> We &apos;re right at that point of transition . </s> ||| <s> Chúng ta đang ở thời điểm của sự chuyển giao . </s>
<s> But I think that there really is something coming along after us . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng tôi nghĩ rằng có một cái gì đó đang bám đuổi chúng ta . </s>
<s> I think it &apos;s very <unk> of us to think that we &apos;re the end product of evolution . </s> ||| <s> Tôi nghĩ rằng chúng ta sẽ quá là tự cao nếu cho rằng chúng ta là sản phẩm cuối cùng của quá trình tiến hoá . </s>
<s> And I think all of us here are a part of producing whatever that next thing is . </s> ||| <s> Và tôi nghĩ rằng tất cả chúng ta ở đây là một phần của sự sản sinh thế hệ tiếp theo - bất kể đó là cái gì . </s>
<s> So lunch is coming along , and I think I will stop at that point , before I get selected out . </s> ||| <s> Bữa trưa đang tới gần , và tôi nghĩ tôi sẽ dừng lại tại đây , trước khi tôi bị loại ra bởi tạo hoá . </s>
<s> So a couple of years ago I started a program to try to get the <unk> tech and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represents pretty much everything they &apos;re supposed to hate ; we have them work in government . </s> ||| <s> Một vài năm trước tôi bắt đầu một chương trình tìm kiếm những siêu sao công nghệ và tạo điều kiện cho họ nghỉ một năm và làm việc trong môi trường dường như họ sẽ rất ghét ; họ phải làm việc cho chính phủ . </s>
<s> The program is called Code for America , and it &apos;s a little bit like a Peace <unk> for geeks . </s> ||| <s> Chương trình này được gọi là Code for America và chương trình này khá giống Peace <unk> cho dân nghiền máy tính . </s>
<s> We select a few fellows every year and we have them work with city governments . </s> ||| <s> Chúng tôi lựa chọn một vài ứng viên mỗi năm , họ sẽ làm việc với chính quyền thành phố . </s>
<s> Instead of sending them off into the Third World , we send them into the <unk> of City Hall . </s> ||| <s> Thay vì đưa họ tới Thế Giới Thứ Ba , chúng tôi đưa họ tới sự náo nhiệt của thành phố . </s>
<s> And there they make great apps , they work with city <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Ở đó , họ sẽ viết ra nhứng ứng dụng tuyệt vời , làm việc với đội ngũ nhân viên . </s>
<s> But really what they &apos;re doing is they &apos;re showing what &apos;s possible with technology today . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng điều mà họ thực sự đang làm nhằm chứng tỏ mọi thứ đều có thể xảy ra trong xã hội công nghệ thông tin ngày nay . </s>
<s> So meet Al . </s> ||| <s> Hãy nói đến Al . </s>
<s> Al is a fire <unk> in the city of Boston . </s> ||| <s> Al là một vòi nước cứu hoả tại Boston . </s>
<s> Here it kind of looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he &apos;s really looking for is for someone to <unk> him out when he gets <unk> in , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at fighting fires when he &apos;s covered in four feet of snow . </s> ||| <s> Nó trông giống như đang tìm kiếm một cuộc hẹn hò , nhưng thực ra nó đang chờ đợi ai đó , bởi anh ấy biết rằng mình không giỏi trong việc dập tắt lửa khi bị chìm trong tuyết dày <unk> . </s>
<s> Now how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique manner ? </s> ||| <s> Làm thế nào nó có thể tìm kiếm sự giúp đỡ trong tình trạng có một không hai như thế này ? </s>
<s> We had a team of fellows in Boston last year through the Code for America program . </s> ||| <s> Năm ngoái , chúng tôi có một đội ở Boston tham gia chương trình Code for America . </s>
<s> They were there in February , and it <unk> a lot in February last year . </s> ||| <s> Họ ở đó trong tháng Hai đầy tuyết . </s>
<s> And they noticed that the city never gets to digging out these fire <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Họ để ý rằng thành phố không bao giờ tháo bỏ những vòi nước chữa cháy . </s>
<s> But one fellow in particular , a guy named Erik <unk> , noticed something else , and that &apos;s that citizens are <unk> out sidewalks right in front of these things . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng một thành viên có tên là Erik <unk> , chú ý tới một điều khác , đó là việc mọi người vẫn thản nhiên đi bộ trước những thứ đó . </s>
<s> So he did what any good developer would do , he wrote an app . </s> ||| <s> Thế là anh ấy làm công việc mà bất cứ lập trình viên tài giỏi nào cũng sẽ làm là viết một ứng dụng . </s>
<s> It &apos;s a cute little app where you can adopt a fire <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Đó là một ứng dụng nhỏ mà bạn có thể định vị các vòi chữa cháy . </s>
<s> So you agree to dig it out when it <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Bạn có thể khoá nó lại khi trời có tuyết </s>
<s> If you do , you get to name it , and he called the first one Al . </s> ||| <s> Mỗi lần làm như vậy , bạn phải đặt tên cho nó , và anh ấy đặt tên chiếc đầu tiên là Al . </s>
<s> And if you don &apos;t , someone can steal it from you . </s> ||| <s> Nếu bạn không làm , người khác có thể chiếm đoạt nó . </s>
<s> So it &apos;s got cute little game dynamics on it . </s> ||| <s> Vậy là có chút động lực cho việc này . </s>
<s> This is a modest little app . </s> ||| <s> Đây là một ứng dụng nhỏ . </s>
<s> It &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the fellows wrote last year . </s> ||| <s> Có lẽ là nhỏ nhất trong số 21 ứng dụng và các thành viên viết vào năm ngoái . </s>
<s> But it &apos;s doing something that no other government technology does . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng nó đã làm một việc mà không một chính phủ nào làm . </s>
<s> It &apos;s spreading <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Nó lan truyền rộng rãi . </s>
<s> There &apos;s a guy in the I.T. department of the City of Honolulu who saw this app and realized that he could use it , not for snow , but to get citizens to adopt tsunami <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Một anh chàng trong văn phòng công nghệ của thành phố Honolulu biết đến ứng dụng này và nhận ra rằng anh ta có thể sử dụng nó , không phải cho tuyết , mà để người dân định vị các đèn cảnh báo sóng thần . </s>
<s> It &apos;s very important that these tsunami <unk> work , but people steal the batteries out of them . </s> ||| <s> Việc những chiếc đèn này hoạt động rất quan trọng , nhưng có người lại ăn cắp năng lượng từ chúng . </s>
<s> So he &apos;s getting citizens to check on them . </s> ||| <s> Vì thế anh ấy giúp người dân có thể kiểm tra những chiếc đèn . </s>
<s> And then Seattle decided to use it to get citizens to clear out clogged storm drains . </s> ||| <s> Sau đó Seattle quyết định sử dụng phần mềm này để giúp người dân tránh khỏi nơi có đường ống dẫn nước bị tắc . </s>
<s> And Chicago just rolled it out to get people to sign up to <unk> sidewalks when it <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Chicago ứng dụng phần mềm cho phép mọi người đăng ký quét dọn vỉa hè khi trời có tuyết . </s>
<s> So we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this . </s> ||| <s> Hiện tại có chín thành phố đang lên kế hoạch sử dụng ứng dụng này . </s>
<s> And this has spread just <unk> , organically , naturally . </s> ||| <s> Việc này đang lan rộng một cách chóng mặt , có trật tự , và tự nhiên </s>
<s> If you know anything about government technology , you know that this isn &apos;t how it normally goes . </s> ||| <s> Nếu bạn biết bất cứ điều gì về công nghệ của nhà nước , bạn sẽ biết rằng việc này xảy ra không bình thường . </s>
<s> <unk> software usually takes a couple of years . </s> ||| <s> Việc cho ra đời một phần mềm thường mất vài năm . </s>
<s> We had a team that worked on a project in Boston last year that took three people about two and a half months . </s> ||| <s> Năm ngoái , chúng tôi có một đội gồm ba người làm việc trong một dự án kéo dài hai tháng rưỡi ở Boston . </s>
<s> It was a way that parents could figure out which were the right public schools for their kids . </s> ||| <s> Dự án giúp cha mẹ tìm kiếm trường công lập phù hợp với con cái mình . </s>
<s> We were told afterward that if that had gone through normal channels , it would have taken at least two years and it would have cost about two million dollars . </s> ||| <s> Có người nói với chúng tôi rằng như bình thường , để xây dựng lên một phần mềm sẽ phải mất ít nhất 2 năm và tiêu tốn khoảng hai triệu đô-la . </s>
<s> And that &apos;s nothing . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng những con số chẳng là gì cả . </s>
<s> There is one project in the California court system right now that so far cost taxpayers two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work . </s> ||| <s> Hiện nay có một dự án trong hệ thống luật pháp California đã tiêu tốn những người đóng thuế hai tỉ đô-la , mà vẫn không hoạt động . </s>
<s> And there are projects like this at every level of government . </s> ||| <s> Và còn nhiều dự án tương tự khác ở mọi cấp độ trong hệ thống chính quyền . </s>
<s> So an app that takes a couple of days to write and then spreads <unk> , that &apos;s sort of a shot across the bow to the institution of government . </s> ||| <s> Vì thế một ứng dụng được xây dựng trong vài ngày rồi lan truyền một cách chóng mặt , đó là con đường tắt nhằm xây dựng hệ thống chính quyền . </s>
<s> It suggests how government could work better -- not more like a private company , as many people think it should . </s> ||| <s> Nó cho thấy cách mà chính phủ có thể hoạt động hiệu quả hơn -- không giống các công ty tư nhân , như nhiều người nghĩ . </s>
<s> And not even like a tech company , but more like the Internet itself . </s> ||| <s> Và thậm chí không giống 1 công ty công nghệ , mà giống Internet thì đúng hơn . </s>
<s> And that means <unk> , it means open , it means <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Điều đó đồng nghĩa với sự không kiểm soát , luôn gợi mở và sản sinh những điều mới . </s>
<s> And that &apos;s important . </s> ||| <s> Điều đó thật quan trọng . </s>
<s> But what &apos;s more important about this app is that it represents how a new generation is tackling the problem of government -- not as the problem of an <unk> institution , but as a problem of collective action . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng điều còn quan trọng hơn đó là nó chỉ ra cách thế hệ mới giải quyết với vấn đề của chính phủ -- không phải vấn đề của một hệ thống cứng nhắc , mà là của những hành động tập thể . </s>
<s> And that &apos;s great news , because , it turns out , we &apos;re very good at collective action with digital technology . </s> ||| <s> Đó là một tin vui , bởi chúng ta sẽ có nhiều hơn những hành động cộng động với sự giúp sức của công nghệ điện tử . </s>
<s> Now there &apos;s a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effectively . </s> ||| <s> Ngày nay có một cộng đồng lớn những người giúp xây dựng các công cụ cần thiết để chúng ta cùng nhau làm việc hiệu quả . </s>
<s> It &apos;s not just Code for America fellows , there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing civic apps every day in their own communities . </s> ||| <s> Đó không chỉ là các thành viên của Code for America , còn hàng trăm người trên khắp đất nước đang viết nên những ứng dụng mang tính đại chúng hàng ngày trong chính cộng đồng của chúng ta . </s>
<s> They haven &apos;t given up on government . </s> ||| <s> Họ chưa từ bỏ </s>
<s> They are frustrated as hell with it , but they &apos;re not complaining about it , they &apos;re fixing it . </s> ||| <s> Họ thấy nản lòng với chính phủ , nhưng họ không than phiền , họ tìm cách sửa chữa . </s>
<s> And these folks know something that we &apos;ve lost sight of . </s> ||| <s> Và những con người này biết rằng chúng ta đã không để chú trọng đến nó . </s>
<s> And that &apos;s that when you strip away all your feelings about politics and the line at the DMV and all those other things that we &apos;re really mad about , government is , at its core , in the words of Tim O <unk> , &quot; What we do together that we can &apos;t do alone . &quot; </s> ||| <s> Đó là khi bạn gạt bỏ mọi cảm xúc về chính trị và ranh giới tại <unk> và tất cả những thứ khiến chúng ta tức giận , chính phủ , và cốt lõi của nó , trong lời nói của Tim O &apos; <unk> , &quot; Chung tay hành động tức là không hành động đơn phương . &quot; </s>
<s> Now a lot of people have given up on government . </s> ||| <s> Giờ đây có rất nhiều người mất niềm tin vào chính phủ . </s>
<s> And if you &apos;re one of those people , I would ask that you reconsider , because things are changing . </s> ||| <s> Và nếu bạn là một trong số những người đó , tôi yêu cầu bạn cân nhắc lại , bởi mọi thứ đang thay đổi . </s>
<s> Politics is not changing ; government is changing . </s> ||| <s> Chính trị không thay đổi ; chính phủ đang . </s>
<s> And because government ultimately <unk> its power from us -- remember &quot; We the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it is going to effect how that change happens . </s> ||| <s> Và bởi chính phủ cương quyết cướp đoạt quyền lực từ chúng ta -- hãy nhớ rằng &quot; Chúng ta là con người ? &quot; -- chúng ta nghĩ gì về việc nó sẽ ảnh hướng tới sự thay đổi . </s>
<s> Now I didn &apos;t know very much about government when I started this program . </s> ||| <s> Khi bắt đầu chương trình này , tôi không biết mấy về chính phủ . </s>
<s> And like a lot of people , I thought government was basically about getting people elected to office . </s> ||| <s> Giống như nhiều người , tôi đã nghĩ chính phủ cơ bản chỉ là bắt mọi người đi bầu cử . </s>
<s> Well after two years , I &apos;ve come to the conclusion that , especially local government , is about <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Sau hai năm , tôi rút ra được kết luận đặc biệt với chính quyền địa phương , về những chú chuột <unk> </s>
<s> This is the call center for the services and information line . </s> ||| <s> Đây là trung tâm thông tin và liên lạc . </s>
<s> It &apos;s generally where you will get if you call <unk> in your city . </s> ||| <s> Đây sẽ là nơi bạn đến nếu bạn gọi <unk> từ thành phố của bạn . </s>
<s> If you should ever have the chance to staff your city &apos;s call center , as our fellow Scott <unk> did as part of the program -- in fact , they all do that -- you will find that people call government with a very wide range of issues , including having an <unk> stuck in your house . </s> ||| <s> Nếu bạn có cơ hội làm việc trong trung tâm liên lạc của thành phố , giống như Scott <unk> , một thành viên của chúng tôi -- trên thực tế , tất cả họ làm -- bạn sẽ phát hiện thấy mọi người gọi tới chính phủ với rất nhiều vấn đề , trong đó có một chú chuột <unk> bị mắc kẹt trong nhà bạn . </s>
<s> So Scott gets this call . </s> ||| <s> Scott nhận thức được điều này . </s>
<s> He types &quot; <unk> &quot; into this official knowledge base . </s> ||| <s> Anh ấy gõ &quot; <unk> &quot; vào kho dữ liệu chính thức . </s>
<s> He doesn &apos;t really come up with anything . He starts with animal control . </s> ||| <s> Anh ấy không hề nghĩ đến điều gì khác . Anh bắt đầu với việc kiểm soát động vật . </s>
<s> And finally , he says , &quot; Look , can you just open all the doors to your house and play music really loud and see if the thing leaves ? &quot; </s> ||| <s> Cuối cùng , anh ấy nói : &quot; Nhìn xem , chẳng phải bạn có thể mở tất cả cánh cửa tới nhà bạn và chơi nhạc thật to và nhìn xem có thứ gì chuyển động ko ? &quot; </s>
<s> So that worked . So <unk> for Scott . </s> ||| <s> Và điều đó đã đúng . Một tràng vỗ tay cho Scott . </s>
<s> But that wasn &apos;t the end of the <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng đó không phải tất cả về loại chuột <unk> . </s>
<s> Boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center . </s> ||| <s> Boston không chỉ có một tổng đài . </s>
<s> It has an app , a Web and mobile app , called <unk> <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Nó còn có 1 ứng dụng , 1 website và 1 ứng dụng trên điện thoại , mang tên <unk> <unk> . </s>
<s> Now we didn &apos;t write this app . </s> ||| <s> Chúng tôi không viết ứng dụng này . </s>
<s> This is the work of the very smart people at the Office of New <unk> <unk> in Boston . </s> ||| <s> Đây là thành quả của những con người xuất sắc tại Văn phòng cơ học thành phố tại Boston . </s>
<s> So one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in : &quot; <unk> in my <unk> . Can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead . </s> ||| <s> Rồi 1 ngày -- đây mới thực sự là báo cáo -- có 1 thứ xảy ra : &quot; 1 chú chuột <unk> trong thùng rác của rôi . Không biết nó chết chưa nữa . </s>
<s> How do I get this removed ? &quot; </s> ||| <s> Làm thế nào để xử lý nó ? &quot; </s>
<s> But what happens with <unk> <unk> is different . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng chuyện xảy ra với <unk> <unk> lại khác . </s>
<s> So Scott was speaking <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Scott nói chuyện trực tiếp . </s>
<s> But on <unk> <unk> everything is public , so everybody can see this . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng trên <unk> <unk> , mọi thứ đều được công khai , để tất cả có thể thấy . </s>
<s> And in this case , a neighbor saw it . </s> ||| <s> Và trong trường hợp này , một người hàng xóm đã thấy . </s>
<s> And the next report we got said , &quot; I walked over to this location , found the <unk> behind the house . </s> ||| <s> Trong bản báo cáo tiếp theo có viết , &quot; Tôi đang đi bộ trong khu vực , thì thấy 1 thùng rác phía sau nhà . </s>
<s> <unk> ? Check . Living ? Yep . </s> ||| <s> 1 chú chuột <unk> sao ? Thử kiểm tra xem . Còn sống ? Đúng vậy . </s>
<s> <unk> <unk> on its side . <unk> home . </s> ||| <s> Dựng thùng rác lên , rồi đi bộ về nhà . </s>
<s> <unk> sweet <unk> . &quot; </s> ||| <s> Chúc ngủ ngon , chú chuột <unk> đáng yêu . &quot; </s>
<s> Pretty simple . </s> ||| <s> Khá đơn giản . </s>
<s> So this is great . This is the digital meeting the physical . </s> ||| <s> Điều này thật thú vị . Đây chính là cách công nghệ tiếp cận với đời sống thực . </s>
<s> And it &apos;s also a great example of government getting in on the <unk> game . </s> ||| <s> Đây cũng là một ví dụ điển hình khác về việc chính phủ triển khai trò chơi cộng đồng . </s>
<s> But it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng đó cũng là ví dụ về việc chính phủ như một hệ thống . </s>
<s> And I don &apos;t mean necessarily a technological definition of platform here . </s> ||| <s> Không hẳn là tôi nói về định nghĩa của hệ thống trong công nghệ . </s>
<s> I &apos;m just talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others . </s> ||| <s> Tôi chỉ đang nói về một hệ thống hỗ trợ con người giúp đỡ lẫn nhau . </s>
<s> So one citizen helped another citizen , but government played a key role here . </s> ||| <s> Mọi người giúp đỡ lẫn nhau , nhưng chính phủ đóng vai trò cốt lõi ở đây . </s>
<s> It connected those two people . </s> ||| <s> Nó kết nối hai người đó lại với nhau . </s>
<s> And it could have connected them with government services if they &apos;d been needed , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services . </s> ||| <s> Nếu cần thiết , các dịch vụ của chính phủ có thể giúp đỡ họ kết nối lại , nhưng một người hàng xóm thì là một giải pháp tốt và tiết kiệm hơn so với các dịch vụ của chính phủ . </s>
<s> When one neighbor helps another , we strengthen our communities . </s> ||| <s> Khi người này giúp người kia , cộng đồng của chúng ta trở nên lớn mạnh hơn . </s>
<s> We call animal control , it just costs a lot of money . </s> ||| <s> Nếu gọi trung tâm quản lý động vật , điều đó sẽ tiêu tốn nhiều tiền bạc hơn . </s>
<s> Now one of the important things we need to think about government is that it &apos;s not the same thing as politics . </s> ||| <s> Một trong những điều quan trọng chúng ta cần nghĩ về chính phủ là nó không giống với chính trị . </s>
<s> And most people get that , but they think that one is the input to the other . </s> ||| <s> Phần lớn mọi người hiểu điều đó , nhưng họ lại nghĩ rằng cái này là đầu vào cho cái kia . </s>
<s> That our input to the system of government is voting . </s> ||| <s> Rằng đầu vào cho hệ thống chính phủ và việc bầu cử . </s>
<s> Now how many times have we elected a political leader -- and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political leader elected -- and then we sit back and we expect government to reflect our values and meet our needs , and then not that much changes ? </s> ||| <s> Xem nào , bao nhiêu lần chúng ta bầu cử 1 nhà lãnh đạo chính trị -- và chúng ta thường tiêu tốn nhiều năng lượng để đi tìm 1 nhà lãnh đạo chính trị -- và rồi chúng ta ngồi lại và hi vọng chính phủ sẽ phản ánh giá trị và thoả mãn nhu cầu của chúng ta , nhưng rồi lại chẳng có mấy thay đổi ? </s>
<s> That &apos;s because government is like a vast ocean and politics is the <unk> layer on top . </s> ||| <s> Đó là vị chính phủ giống như một đại dương mênh mông và chính trị chỉ là một lớp dày 6 inch trên bề mặt . </s>
<s> And what &apos;s under that is what we call bureaucracy . </s> ||| <s> Và những gì ở phía dưới được chúng ta gọi là bộ máy quan liêu . </s>
<s> And we say that word with such contempt . </s> ||| <s> Chúng ta nói ra những từ ngữ đó với sự khinh miệt . </s>
<s> But it &apos;s that contempt that keeps this thing that we own and we pay for as something that &apos;s working against us , this other thing , and then we &apos;re <unk> ourselves . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng chính sự khinh miệt đó đã giúp chúng ta thấy chúng ta có gì và phải trả giá cho thứ chống lại chúng ta , và rồi lại làm hại chính chúng ta . </s>
<s> People seem to think politics is sexy . </s> ||| <s> Có người cho rằng chính trị rất hấp dẫn . </s>
<s> If we want this institution to work for us , we &apos;re going to have to make bureaucracy sexy . </s> ||| <s> Nếu chúng ta muốn chính quyền làm việc cho mình , chúng ta phải khiến cho hệ thống đó trở nên hấp dẫn . </s>
<s> Because that &apos;s where the real work of government happens . </s> ||| <s> Bởi đó là nơi những công việc thực sự của chính phủ diễn ra . </s>
<s> We have to engage with the machinery of government . </s> ||| <s> Chúng ta phải đầu tư vào cơ cấu bộ máy chính phủ . </s>
<s> So that &apos;s <unk> movement has done . </s> ||| <s> Đó chính là những gì <unk> đã làm . </s>
<s> Have you seen these guys ? </s> ||| <s> Bạn đã bao giờ thấy những con người này ? </s>
<s> It &apos;s a group of concerned citizens that have written a very detailed <unk> report that &apos;s a response to the <unk> &apos;s request for comment on the Financial <unk> Bill . </s> ||| <s> Đó là một nhóm các công dân tâm huyết đã viết một bản báo cáo chi tiết dài <unk> trang để trả lời cho đề nghị của <unk> về việc góp ý cho Dự thảo cải cách tài chính . </s>
<s> That &apos;s not being politically active , that &apos;s being <unk> active . </s> ||| <s> Đó không phải là chính trị , mà là hệ thống quan liêu . </s>
<s> Now for those of us who &apos;ve given up on government , it &apos;s time that we asked ourselves about the world that we want to leave for our children . </s> ||| <s> Với những ai mất niềm tin vào chính phủ , đây là lúc chúng ta hỏi bản thân về 1 thế giới chúng ta muốn để lại cho con cháu . </s>
<s> You have to see the enormous challenges that they &apos;re going to face . </s> ||| <s> Bạn phải nhận ra những thách thức to lớn mà chúng sẽ phải đối mặt . </s>
<s> Do we really think we &apos;re going to get where we need to go without fixing the one institution that can act on behalf of all of us ? </s> ||| <s> Chúng ta sẽ đạt được những điều chúng ta cần phải làm mà không chấn chỉnh lại chính quyền đại diện cho tất cả chúng ta không ? </s>
<s> We can &apos;t do without government , but we do need it to be more effective . </s> ||| <s> Chúng ta không thể làm vậy nếu không có chính phủ , chúng ta cần nó để đạt được hiệu quả hơn . </s>
<s> The good news is that technology is making it possible to fundamentally reframe the function of government in a way that can actually scale by <unk> civil society . </s> ||| <s> Tin vui là giờ đây công nghệ đang giúp cải thiện khá nhiều chức năng của chính phủ một cách làm mang lại hiệu quả thực sự thắt chặt hơn quan hệ cộng đồng . </s>
<s> And there &apos;s a generation out there that &apos;s grown up on the Internet , and they know that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you just have to architect the systems the right way . </s> ||| <s> Chúng ta có một thế hệ lớn lên với sự phát triển của Internet , và chúng ta biết không khó khăn gì để có thể hợp sức với nhau , bạn chỉ cần điều khiển hệ thống đi đúng hướng . </s>
<s> Now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so I am , <unk> , almost a generation older than most of them . </s> ||| <s> Giờ đây độ tuổi trung bình của các thành viên trong nhóm chúng tôi là 28 , thật ghen tị là tôi gần như già hơn tất cả họ . </s>
<s> This is a generation that &apos;s grown up taking their voices pretty much for granted . </s> ||| <s> Đây là thế hệ dùng tiếng nói của mình để đấu tranh cho quyền lợi . </s>
<s> They &apos;re not fighting that battle that we &apos;re all fighting about who gets to speak ; they all get to speak . </s> ||| <s> Cuộc chiến của họ không giống chúng ta không phải việc ai sẽ là người lên tiếng ; mà tất cả họ sẽ phải làm điều đó . </s>
<s> They can express their opinion on any channel at any time , and they do . </s> ||| <s> Họ có thể đưa ra ý kiến trên bất cứ phương tiện nào và vào lúc nào , và họ vẫn đang làm điều đó . </s>
<s> So when they &apos;re faced with the problem of government , they don &apos;t care as much about using their voices . </s> ||| <s> Khi họ đối mặt với vấn đề của chúng phủ , họ có thể không quan tâm lắm đến việc sử dụng tiếng nói của mình . </s>
<s> They &apos;re using their hands . </s> ||| <s> Họ sử dụng đôi bàn tay của mình . </s>
<s> They &apos;re using their hands to write applications that make government work better . </s> ||| <s> Họ sử dụng đôi bàn tay của mình để viết lên những ứng dụng giúp chính phủ làm việc tốt hơn . </s>
<s> And those applications let us use our hands to make our communities better . </s> ||| <s> Những ứng dụng này giúp chính ta cả thiện xã hội . </s>
<s> That could be <unk> out a <unk> , pulling a weed , turning over a garbage can with an <unk> in it . </s> ||| <s> Đó có thể là việc xử lý vòi nước chữa cháy , dọn đống cỏ dại , dựng lại thùng rác có 1 chú chuột <unk> bên trong . </s>
<s> And certainly , we could have been <unk> out those fire <unk> all along , and many people do . </s> ||| <s> Chắc chắn , chúng ta có thể xử lý vòi nước chữa cháy , và nhiều người đã làm vậy . </s>
<s> But these apps are like little digital <unk> that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of government , putting in our taxes and getting back services . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng những ứng dụng như cộng nghệ nhắc nhở rằng chúng ta không chỉ là người tiêu dùng , và chúng ta không chỉ là nhà tiêu dùng của chính phủ , đóng góp thuế và nhận lại dịch vụ . </s>

<s> I would like to talk to you about why many <unk> projects fail . </s> ||| <s> Tôi muốn nói với các bạn lý do tại sao nhiều dự án y tế điện tử lại thất bại </s>
<s> And I really think that the most important thing of it is that we stopped listening to patients . </s> ||| <s> Và tôi thực sự nghĩ rằng điều quan trọng nhất là chúng ta không còn lắng nghe bệnh nhân nữa . </s>
<s> And one of the things we did at <unk> University is we <unk> a chief listening officer . </s> ||| <s> Một trong những điều mà chúng tôi thực hiện tại trường đại học <unk> là bổ nhiệm một chuyên viên lắng nghe </s>
<s> Not in a very scientific way -- she puts up a little cup of coffee or cup of tea and asks patients , family , relatives , &quot; What &apos;s up ? </s> ||| <s> Không phải theo một cách khoa học -- cô ấy đặt một tách cà phê hoặc một tách trà nhỏ và hỏi thăm bệnh nhân , gia đình và họ hàng , &quot; Có chuyện gì vậy ? </s>
<s> How could we help you ? &quot; </s> ||| <s> Chúng tôi có thể giúp gì được cho bạn ? &quot; </s>
<s> And we think , we like to think , that this is one of the major problems why all -- maybe not all -- but most of the <unk> projects fail , since we stopped listening . </s> ||| <s> Và chúng tôi nghĩ rằng đây là một trong những vấn đề chính mà tại sao tất cả -- có lẽ không phải tất cả -- nhưng hầu hết các dự án y tế điện tử lại thất bại , kể từ khi chúng ta không còn lắng nghe nữa . </s>
<s> This is my <unk> scale . It &apos;s a very simple thing . </s> ||| <s> Đây là chiếc cân điện tử của tôi . Đó là một thiết bị rất đơn giản . </s>

<s> But that &apos;s the nicest thing that could happen , since this is peer pressure , peer pressure used to help patients -- since this could be used for obesity , it could be used to stop smoking in patients . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng đó là điều hay nhất có thể xảy ra vì đây gọi là áp lực đồng đẳng , áp lực đồng đẳng đã từng giúp các bệnh nhân -- kể từ khi nó được sử dụng đối với bệnh béo phì , nó cũng có thể sử dụng để các bệnh nhân bỏ hút thuốc . </s>

<s> As of next week , it will soon be available . </s> ||| <s> Vào tuần tới , một thiết bị sẽ sớm được ra mắt . </s>

<s> I &apos;m here to share my photography . </s> ||| <s> Tôi ở đây để chia sẻ với các bạn phong cách nhiếp ảnh của tôi . </s>
<s> Or is it photography ? </s> ||| <s> Nó có phải là nhiếp ảnh không nhỉ ? </s>
<s> Because , of course , this is a photograph that you can &apos;t take with your camera . </s> ||| <s> Vì , có lẽ , đây là nhiếp ảnh mà bạn không thể mang theo máy ảnh . </s>
<s> Yet , my interest in photography started as I got my first digital camera at the age of 15 . </s> ||| <s> Sở thích về nhiếp ảnh của tôi đã bắt đầu khi tôi có một <unk> máy ảnh điện tử ở tuổi 15 . </s>
<s> It mixed with my earlier passion for drawing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the process was in the planning instead . </s> ||| <s> Nó đan xen với niềm đam mê về hội hoạ của tôi , nhưng có một chút khác biệt , vì sử dụng một chiếc máy ảnh , quá trình được lên kế hoạch . </s>
<s> And when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the trigger . </s> ||| <s> Và khi bạn dùng máy ảnh để chụp ảnh , quá trình kết thúc khi bạn bấm nút . </s>
<s> So to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place and the right time . </s> ||| <s> Nên nhiếp ảnh với tôi như là thiên về việc có mặt đúng chỗ , đúng thời điểm . </s>
<s> I felt like anyone could do that . </s> ||| <s> Tôi cảm thấy như bất cứ ai cũng có thể làm điều đó . </s>
<s> So I wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when you press the trigger . </s> ||| <s> Nên tôi muốn tạo ra một sự khác biệt , một thứ gì đó tại nơi quá trình bắt đầu khi bạn bấm nút . </s>
<s> Photos like this : construction going on along a busy road . </s> ||| <s> Những tấm ảnh như thế này : việc xây dựng diễn ra dọc theo con đường đông đúc . </s>
<s> But it has an unexpected twist . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng nó có một khúc ngoặt không mong muốn . </s>
<s> And despite that , it <unk> a level of <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Và bất chấp điều đó , nó lưu giữ mức độ chân thực . </s>
<s> Or photos like these -- both dark and colorful , but all with a common goal of retaining the level of <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Hay những bức ảnh như thế này -- cả tối màu và sặc sỡ , nhưng tất cả với chung một kết quả của việc lưu giữ mức độ chân thực . </s>
<s> When I say <unk> , I mean <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Khi tôi nói tính chân thực , ý <unk> tôi là tính chân thực của ảnh . </s>
<s> Because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can capture really , but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph . </s> ||| <s> Bởi vì , tất nhiên , nó không phải là một thứ mà bạn thực sự có thể nắm được , nhưng tôi luôn muốn nó có vẻ như nắm bắt được theo một cách nào đấy như là một bức ảnh . </s>
<s> Photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick . </s> ||| <s> Những bức ảnh nơi mà bạn sẽ cần một chút thời gian để tư duy để tìm ra một bí quyết . </s>
<s> So it &apos;s more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really . </s> ||| <s> Nên nó thực sự là việc nắm bắt ý tưởng hơn là nắm bắt một khoảnh khắc . </s>
<s> But what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ? </s> ||| <s> Nhưng bí quyết là gì mà khiến nó trông như có thật ? </s>
<s> Is it something about the details or the colors ? </s> ||| <s> Có phải là một chút gì đó về chi tiết hay là về màu sắc ? </s>
<s> Is it something about the light ? </s> ||| <s> Có phải một chút gì đó về ánh sáng ? </s>
<s> What creates the illusion ? </s> ||| <s> Điều gì tạo nên ảo giác ? </s>
<s> Sometimes the perspective is the illusion . </s> ||| <s> Đôi khi phối cảnh tạo nên ảo giác . </s>
<s> But in the end , it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng cuối cùng nó dẫn đến việc làm thế nào chúng ta diễn giải thế giới và làm thế nào để nhận ra nó trên một bề mặt hai chiều . </s>
<s> It &apos;s not really what is realistic , it &apos;s what we think looks realistic really . </s> ||| <s> Nó không thực sự là cái gì là thực , nó là cái chúng ta nghĩ rằng nó là thực . </s>
<s> So I think the basics are quite simple . </s> ||| <s> Nên tôi nghĩ những điều cơ bản thì khá là đơn giản . </s>
<s> I just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alternate reality . </s> ||| <s> Tôi chỉ xem nó là câu đố của hiện thực nơi mà bạn có thể lấy các phần khác nhau của hiện thực và nhóm chúng lại để tạo nên một hiện thực tương đương . </s>
<s> And let me show you a simple example . </s> ||| <s> Hãy để tôi cho các bạn xem một ví dụ đơn giản này . </s>
<s> Here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects , something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world . </s> ||| <s> Chúng ta có ở đây ba vật thể có hình dung hoàn hảo , những vật mà chúng ta đều có thể liên quan đến cuộc sống trong thế giới không gian ba chiều . </s>
<s> But combined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three-dimensional , like it could exist . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng kết hợp theo một cách nào đấy , chúng tạo ra một thứ mà trông vẫn như thể ba chiều , như thể nó tồn tại . </s>
<s> But at the same time , we know it can &apos;t . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng cùng một lúc với nhau , chúng ta biết là không thể được . </s>
<s> So we trick our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense . </s> ||| <s> Nên chúng ta mới đánh lừa bộ não , vì một cách đơn giản não bộ chúng ta không chấp nhận những yếu tố mà trên thực tế là vô lý </s>
<s> And I see the same process with combining photographs . </s> ||| <s> Và tôi thấy rằng kết hợp các bức ảnh cũng có chung một quá trình như thế </s>
<s> It &apos;s just really about combining different realities . </s> ||| <s> Đó thực sự chỉ là <unk> việc kết hợp các hiện thực khác nhau . </s>
<s> So the things that make a photograph look realistic , I think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our daily lives . </s> ||| <s> Nên những thứ làm cho bức ảnh trông có thực , Tôi nghĩ , đó là những thứ mà chúng ta chưa bao giờ nghĩ đến , những thứ ở ngay quanh chúng ta trong cuộc sống hàng ngày . </s>
<s> But when combining photographs , this is really important to consider , because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng khi kết hợp các bức ảnh lại , đây là một điều quan trọng mà thực sự phải cân nhắc , vì nếu không , trông nó sẽ không ổn thế nào đó . </s>
<s> So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result . </s> ||| <s> Nên tôi muốn đưa ra ba nguyên tắc cơ bản cần tuân theo để đạt được một kết quả như ý . </s>
<s> As you can see , these images aren &apos;t really special . </s> ||| <s> Như các bạn thấy ở đây , những bức ảnh này trông chẳng có gì là đặc biệt . </s>
<s> But combined , they can create something like this . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng kết hợp lại , chúng có thể tạo ra một thứ như thế này . </s>
<s> So the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective . </s> ||| <s> Nên nguyên tắc đầu tiên đó là sự kết hợp các bức ảnh nên có chung một ngoại cảnh </s>
<s> Secondly , photos combined should have the same type of light . </s> ||| <s> Thứ hai , kết hợp các bức ảnh nên có cùng một kiểu ánh sáng . </s>
<s> And these two images both fulfill these two requirements -- shot at the same height and in the same type of light . </s> ||| <s> Và hai bức ảnh nay đều cùng thoả mãn hai điều kiện -- Được chụp ở cùng một độ cao và ở cùng một kiểu ánh sáng . </s>
<s> The third one is about making it impossible to distinguish where the different images begin and end by making it <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Nguyên tắc thứ ba là làm cho nó trông thật giả tưởng ở ngay nơi mà những bức ảnh khác nhau bắt đầu và kết thúc bằng cách làm cho chúng liền mạch . </s>
<s> Make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed . </s> ||| <s> Khó có thể nói làm thế nào hình ảnh được tạo ra </s>
<s> So by matching color , contrast and <unk> in the borders between the different images , adding photographic <unk> like depth of field , <unk> colors and noise , we erase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically . </s> ||| <s> Nên bằng cách kết hợp màu sắc , độ tương phản và ánh sáng tại các viền ranh giới giữa các bức ảnh khác nhau , thêm vào các khuyết tật ảnh như chiều sâu của cánh đồng , khử đi màu sắc và bụi ảnh , chúng tôi xoá đi các đường viền giữa ở bức ảnh khác nhau và làm cho nó như thể là một bức đồng <unk> bất chấp một thực tế bức ảnh về cơ bản có thể bao gồm cả trăm lớp nền . </s>
<s> So here &apos;s another example . </s> ||| <s> Sau đây là một ví dụ . </s>
<s> One might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what &apos;s manipulated . </s> ||| <s> Ai đó có thể nghĩ rằng đây chỉ là bức ảnh phong cảnh và phần ở dưới đã được chỉnh sửa . </s>
<s> But this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng bức ảnh này thì đã hoàn toàn được tạo ra bởi những bức ảnh từ các khu vực khác nhau . </s>
<s> I personally think that it &apos;s easier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to compromise with the ideas in your head . </s> ||| <s> cá nhân tôi nghĩ rằng sẽ dễ hơn để thậm chí tạo ra bối cảnh hơn là tìm ra bối cảnh , vì tiếp đó bạn không cân phải sắp xếp các ý tưởng trong đầu nữa . </s>
<s> But it does require a lot of planning . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng nó thực sự đòi hỏi rất nhiều kế hoạch . </s>
<s> And getting this idea during winter , I knew that I had several months to plan it , to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle basically . </s> ||| <s> Và có được ý tưởng này trong suốt mùa đông , tôi biết mình phải mất vài tháng để chuẩn bị , để tìm các địa điểm khác nhau cho các phần của bức ảnh . </s>
<s> So for example , the fish was captured on a fishing trip . </s> ||| <s> Ví dụ , con cá được bắt trong chuyến đi câu . </s>
<s> The shores are from a different location . </s> ||| <s> Bờ biển thì ở một nơi khác . </s>
<s> The underwater part was captured in a stone pit . </s> ||| <s> Phần dưới nước thì được chụp trong một hố đá . </s>
<s> And yeah , I even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more Swedish . </s> ||| <s> Và nữa , tôi thậm chí còn đặt ngôi nhà lên đỉnh của hòn đảo làm cho nó trông Thuỵ Điển hoá hơn . </s>
<s> So to achieve a realistic result , I think it comes down to planning . </s> ||| <s> Nên để <unk> đạt được một kết quả chân thực , Tôi nghĩ nó đi đến việc lập kế hoạch . </s>
<s> It always starts with a sketch , an idea . </s> ||| <s> Luôn có một sự bắt đầu với một phác thảo , một ý tưởng . </s>
<s> Then it &apos;s about combining the different photographs . </s> ||| <s> Tiếp đó là kết hợp các bức ảnh khác nhau . </s>
<s> And here every piece is very well planned . </s> ||| <s> Và đây , các phần được sắp xếp rất ổn . </s>
<s> And if you do a good job capturing the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic . </s> ||| <s> Và nếu các bạn giỏi chụp ảnh , kết quả có thể sẽ rất tuyệt vời và cũng khá là thực tế . </s>
<s> So all the tools are out there , and the only thing that limits us is our imagination . </s> ||| <s> Mọi công cụ đều ở ngay đây , và thứ duy nhất làm giới hạn của chúng ta chính là trí tượng tượng . </s>
<s> Thank you . </s> ||| <s> Cảm ơn . </s>
<s> This may sound strange , but I &apos;m a big fan of the concrete block . </s> ||| <s> Điều này nghe có vẻ kì lạ , nhưng tôi là một fan bự của những viên gạch bê tông . </s>
<s> The first concrete blocks were manufactured in <unk> with a very simple idea : modules made of cement of a fixed measurement that fit together . </s> ||| <s> Những khối gạch bê tông đầu tiên được sản xuất vào năm <unk> với ý tưởng rất đơn giản : những khối chuẩn bằng xi măng với kích cỡ cố định khớp với nhau . </s>
<s> Very quickly concrete blocks became the <unk> construction unit in the world . </s> ||| <s> Những viên gạch đã nhanh chóng trở thành loại vật liệu xây dựng được sử dụng nhiều nhất trên thế giới . </s>
<s> They enabled us to to build things that were larger than us , buildings , bridges , one brick at a time . </s> ||| <s> Chúng giúp chúng ta xây dựng những thứ lớn hơn bản thân mình , các toà nhà , các cây cầu , từng viên gạch một . </s>
<s> Essentially concrete blocks had become the building block of our time . </s> ||| <s> Có thể nói gạch bê tông đã trở thành những viên gạch xây nên kỉ nguyên của chúng ta . </s>
<s> Almost a hundred years later in 1947 , <unk> came up with this . </s> ||| <s> Sau gần 100 năm , vào năm 1947 , <unk> đã giới thiệu thứ này . </s>
<s> It was called the <unk> <unk> <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Nó được gọi là <unk> Tự <unk> </s>
<s> And in a few short years , <unk> bricks took place in every household . </s> ||| <s> Và chỉ trong vài năm ngắn ngủi , những viên gạch <unk> đã có mặt tại mọi nhà . </s>
<s> It &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion bricks have been produced -- or 75 bricks for every person on the planet . </s> ||| <s> Theo ước tính , có hơn 400 tỉ viên gạch <unk> đã được sản xuất -- hay 75 viên cho mỗi người trên trái đất . </s>
<s> You don &apos;t have to be an engineer to make beautiful houses , beautiful bridges , beautiful buildings . </s> ||| <s> Bạn không cần phải là một kĩ sư để có thể xây nên những căn nhà đẹp , những cây cầu đẹp hay những toà nhà đẹp . </s>
<s> <unk> made it accessible . </s> ||| <s> <unk> đã làm điều đó trở nên khả thi . </s>
<s> <unk> has essentially taken the concrete block , the building block of the world , and made it into the building block of our imagination . </s> ||| <s> <unk> đã lấy khối gạch bê tông , những khối gạch xây nên thế giới , và làm nó thành những viên gạch của trí tưởng tượng . </s>
<s> Meanwhile the exact same year , at Bell <unk> the next revolution was about to be announced , the next building block . </s> ||| <s> Cũng trong chính năm đó , ở phòng thí nghiệm Bell một cách mạng kế tiếp sắp được công bố , thế hệ tiếp theo của những viên gạch . </s>
<s> The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of static bricks piled on top of each other to a world where everything was interactive . </s> ||| <s> <unk> là một cấu kiện điện tử bằng nhựa mà sẽ đưa chúng ta từ thế giới của những khối gạch bất động chồng lên nhau đến thế giới mà mọi thứ tương tác được với nhau . </s>
<s> Like the concrete block , the transistor allows you to build much larger , more complex circuits , one brick at a time . </s> ||| <s> Giống như viên gạch bê tông , transistor cho phép bạn xây những mạch điện lớn và phức tạp hơn , từng viên gạch một . </s>
<s> But there &apos;s a main difference : The transistor was only for experts . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng có một sự khác biệt lớn : <unk> chỉ dành cho chuyên gia . </s>
<s> I personally don &apos;t accept this , that the building block of our time is reserved for experts , so I decided to change that . </s> ||| <s> Cá nhân tôi không chấp nhận điều này , rằng những viên gạch xây nên kỉ nguyên hiện đại lại chỉ dành cho những chuyên gia , nên tôi đã quyết định thay đổi nó . </s>
<s> Eight years ago when I was at the Media Lab , I started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers . </s> ||| <s> Tám năm trước khi tôi còn ở phòng nghiên cứu truyền thông , tôi đã khám phá ra ý tưởng đó là làm sao để đưa khả năng kĩ sư đến với nghệ sĩ và nhà thiết kế . </s>
<s> A few years ago I started developing <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Một vài năm trước tôi đã bắt đầu phát triển <unk> . </s>
<s> Let me show you how they work . </s> ||| <s> Để tôi cho bạn thấy chúng hoạt động ra sao . </s>
<s> <unk> are electronic modules with each one specific function . </s> ||| <s> <unk> là những cấu kiện điện tử với những chức năng khác nhau . </s>
<s> They &apos;re <unk> to be light , sound , motors and sensors . </s> ||| <s> Chúng đã được thiết kế sẵn để trở thành ánh sáng , âm thanh , động cơ và cảm biến . </s>
<s> And the best part about it is they snap together with magnets . </s> ||| <s> Và phần thú vị nhất về chúng là chúng kết dính với nhau nhờ nam châm . </s>
<s> So you can &apos;t put them the wrong way . </s> ||| <s> Nên bạn không thể đặt chúng sai được . </s>
<s> The bricks are <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Những &quot; viên gạch &quot; này đã được đánh dấu bằng màu . </s>
<s> Green is output , blue is power , pink is input and orange is wire . </s> ||| <s> Xanh lá cây là đầu ra , xanh biển là nguồn điện , hồng là đầu vào và da cam là dây dẫn . </s>
<s> So all you need to do is snap a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making larger circuits . </s> ||| <s> Thế nên những việc bạn cần làm là nối xanh biển với xanh lá và rồi rất nhanh chóng bạn sẽ có thể bắt tay vào làm những mạch lớn hơn . </s>
<s> You put a blue to a green , you can make light . </s> ||| <s> Bạn gắn xanh biển với xanh lá , bạn có thể làm ra mạch đèn . </s>
<s> You can put a knob in between and now you &apos;ve made a little <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Bạn cho một núm xoay vào giữa và giờ bạn có thể chỉnh sáng tối cho đèn . </s>
<s> <unk> out the knob for a pulse <unk> , which is here , and now you &apos;ve made a little <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Thay núm xoay bằng khối tạo xung , như thế này , và giờ bạn đã có một mạch đèn nhấp nháy . </s>
<s> Add this <unk> for some extra punch and you &apos;ve created a noise machine . </s> ||| <s> <unk> thêm chiếc chuông điện này và giờ bạn đã tạo ra máy tạo tiếng động . </s>
<s> I &apos;m going to stop that . </s> ||| <s> Tôi sẽ tắt tiếng này đi . </s>
<s> So beyond simple play , <unk> are actually pretty powerful . </s> ||| <s> Như các bạn đã thấy , không chỉ đơn giản để chơi <unk> còn tỏ ra là một công cụ mạnh . </s>
<s> Instead of having to program , to wire , to <unk> , <unk> allow you to program using very simple intuitive gestures . </s> ||| <s> Thay vì phải lập trình , nối dây hay hàn mạch , <unk> cho phép bạn lập trình bằng những thao tác trực quan đơn giản . </s>
<s> So to make this blink faster or slower , you would just turn this knob and basically make it pulse faster or slower . </s> ||| <s> Để làm cho mạch <unk> nhấp nháy nhanh hoặc chậm hơn , bạn chỉ cần xoay núm vặn này và thay đổi tốc độ nháy đen một cách đơn giản . </s>

<s> And nobody seems to be making a fuss about it . </s> ||| <s> Và có vẻ như không ai định &quot; làm ầm lên &quot; về chuyện này . </s>

<s> If we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the online world , we can group the attacks based on the attackers . </s> ||| <s> Nhìn lại những gì đang thật sự diễn ra trong thế giới mạng , chúng ta có thể phân loại các hoạt động tấn công mạng dựa trên những kẻ tấn công </s>
<s> We have three main groups . </s> ||| <s> Có ba nguồn tấn công chính . </s>
<s> We have online criminals . </s> ||| <s> Từ những tội phạm mạng </s>
<s> Like here , we have Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of Kiev in Ukraine . </s> ||| <s> Như ở đây , chúng ta có <unk> <unk> đến từ thành phố Kiev , Ukraine </s>
<s> And the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand . </s> ||| <s> Và động lực của loại tội phạm mạng này rất đơn giản và dễ hiểu . </s>
<s> These guys make money . </s> ||| <s> Kiếm tiền ! </s>
<s> They use online attacks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it . </s> ||| <s> Họ sử dụng các hoạt động tấn công trực tuyến để kiếm thật nhiều tiền , rất rất nhiều tiền . </s>
<s> We actually have several cases of <unk> online , <unk> , who made money with their attacks . </s> ||| <s> Một số ví dụ điển hình về những triệu phú đến từ thế giới mạng những người kiếm được bộn tiền từ hoạt động tấn công mạng . </s>
<s> Here &apos;s <unk> <unk> form <unk> in Estonia . </s> ||| <s> Đây là <unk> <unk> đến từ <unk> , Estonia </s>
<s> This is Alfred <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Alfred <unk> . </s>
<s> This is Stephen <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Stephen <unk> . </s>
<s> This is <unk> <unk> . </s> ||| <s> <unk> <unk> . </s>
<s> This is Matthew Anderson , <unk> <unk> and so on and so on . </s> ||| <s> Matthew Anderson , <unk> <unk> vân vân và vân vân . </s>
<s> These guys make their <unk> online , but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking <unk> to steal money from our bank accounts while we do online banking , or with <unk> to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer . </s> ||| <s> Họ tìm kiếm sự giàu có từ hoạt động trên mạng , thông qua các cách thức bất hợp pháp như việc sử dụng các <unk> tấn công hệ thống ngân hàng để lấy cắp tiền từ tài khoản của chúng ta khi chúng ta thực hiện các giao dịch trực tuyến hoặc với các phần mềm ghi lại thao tác bàn phím giúp họ có được thông tin thẻ tín dụng khi chúng ta mua hàng trực tuyến từ những máy tính bị lây nhiễm . </s>
<s> The U.S. Secret Service , two months ago , <unk> the Swiss bank account of Mr. Sam <unk> right here , and that bank account had <unk> million U.S. dollars on it when it was frozen . </s> ||| <s> Cơ quan mật vụ Hoa Kỳ , 2 tháng trước đã đóng băng tài khoản ngân hàng Thuỵ Sỹ của Sam <unk> , người trong ảnh với <unk> triệu đô la trong tài khoản tại thời điểm bị đóng băng . </s>
<s> Mr. <unk> himself is on the loose ; nobody knows where he is . </s> ||| <s> <unk> hiện đang lẩn trốn ; và không ai biết anh ta đang ở đâu . </s>
<s> And I claim it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more likely for any of us to become the victim of a crime online than here in the real world . </s> ||| <s> Và tôi khẳng định rằng ngày nay nguy cơ mà chúng ta trở thành nạn nhân của tội phạm mạng còn lớn hơn nguy cơ trong thế giới thực này . </s>
<s> And it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse . </s> ||| <s> Và một sự thật rõ ràng là những hiểm hoạ này đang ngày càng trở nên tồi tệ hơn . </s>
<s> In the future , the majority of crime will be happening online . </s> ||| <s> Trong tương lai không xa , phần lớn các vụ phạm pháp sẽ xảy ra ở trên thế giới mạng . </s>
<s> The second major group of attackers that we are watching today are not motivated by money . </s> ||| <s> Loại tấn công mạng thứ hai mà chúng ta thấy hiện nay không đến vì mục đích kiếm tiền . </s>
<s> They &apos;re motivated by something else -- motivated by protests , motivated by an opinion , motivated by the laughs . </s> ||| <s> Họ được thúc đẩy vì những mục đích khác -- chống đối chính phủ , bất đồng chính kiến , và đôi khi cũng chỉ để vui đùa . </s>
<s> Groups like Anonymous have <unk> up over the last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online attacks . </s> ||| <s> Các nhóm như <unk> đã nổi dậy trong 12 tháng qua và đã trở thành một lực lượng trọng yếu trong cuộc chơi tấn công mạng này . </s>
<s> So those are the three main attackers : criminals who do it for the money , <unk> like Anonymous doing it for the protest , but then the last group are nation states , governments doing the attacks . </s> ||| <s> Như vậy chúng ta có ba nhóm tấn công chính : những kẻ tội phạm với mục đích kiếm tiền bất chính những <unk> như <unk> hoạt động để phản kháng và cuối cùng chính là chính phủ của chúng ta , chính phủ đang tấn công chúng ta . </s>
<s> And then we look at cases like what happened in <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Có rất nhiều trường hợp giống như những gì đã xảy ra tại <unk> . </s>
<s> This is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens . </s> ||| <s> Đây là một ví dụ điển hình về những gì sẽ xảy ra khi chính phủ thực hiện tấn công chống lại người dân của chính họ . </s>
<s> <unk> is a <unk> Authority from The Netherlands -- or actually , it was . </s> ||| <s> <unk> là một công ty cấp phép chứng thực đến từ Hà Lan -- hoặc ít nhất họ cũng đã từng là như vậy . </s>
<s> It was running into <unk> last fall because they were hacked into . </s> ||| <s> Họ đã phải nộp đơn xin phá sản mùa thu năm ngoái vì hệ thống mạng của họ đã bị phá huỷ . </s>
<s> Somebody broke in and they hacked it thoroughly . </s> ||| <s> Ai đó đã xâm nhập vào hệ thống và phá huỷ nó hoàn toàn . </s>
<s> And I asked last week in a meeting with Dutch government representatives , I asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found plausible that people died because of the <unk> hack . </s> ||| <s> Vào tuần trước , trong một buổi gặp với đại diện chính phủ Hà Lan , Tôi có đặt câu hỏi cho một lãnh đạo của họ rằng liệu ông có thấy là hợp lý không nếu có ai đó phải chết vì việc <unk> bị tấn công . </s>
<s> And his answer was yes . </s> ||| <s> Và &quot; <unk> &quot; là câu trả lời của ông ta . </s>
<s> So how do people die as the result of a hack like this ? </s> ||| <s> Làm thế nào mà việc tấn công này có thể khiến ai đó mất mạng được ? </s>
<s> Well <unk> is a <unk> </s> ||| <s> <unk> là một công ty cung cấp dịch vụ chứng thực </s>
<s> They sell certificates . </s> ||| <s> Họ bán các chứng chỉ bảo mật </s>
<s> What do you do with certificates ? </s> ||| <s> Bạn sẽ làm gì với những chứng chỉ đó ? </s>
<s> Well you need a certificate if you have a website that has <unk> , <unk> encrypted services , services like <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Thực tế thì bạn cần một chứng thực như vậy nếu bạn có một trang web sử dụng giao thức <unk> với dịch vụ mã hoá <unk> , là kiểu dịch vụ mà <unk> đang sử dụng . </s>
<s> Now we all , or a big part of us , use <unk> or one of their competitors , but these services are especially popular in <unk> states like Iran , where dissidents use foreign services like <unk> because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services and they are encrypted over <unk> connections , so the local government can &apos;t <unk> on their discussions . </s> ||| <s> Tất cả chúng ta , hoặc ít nhất là phần lớn chúng ta đang sử dụng <unk> hoặc một ứng dụng email tương tự khác , và những dịch vụ này đặc biệt phổ biến tại các quốc gia chuyên chế như Iran , nơi mà các nhà bất đồng chính kiến sẽ sử dụng các dịch vụ từ nước ngoài như <unk> bởi họ biết rõ <unk> đáng tin cậy hơn các dịch vụ nội địa khác và nó còn được mã hoá bởi giao thức <unk> do đó chính phủ không thể nghe lén được các thông tin mà họ trao đổi . </s>
<s> Except they can if they hack into a foreign <unk> </s> ||| <s> Nhưng mọi thứ sẽ khác , nếu chính phủ có thể tấn công vào các đơn vị cung cấp chứng chỉ bảo mật </s>
<s> and issue rogue certificates . </s> ||| <s> và tạo ra các chứng chỉ giả mạo . </s>
<s> And this is exactly what happened with the case of <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Và đó chính xác là điều đã xảy ra với <unk> . </s>
<s> What about Arab Spring and things that have been happening , for example , in Egypt ? </s> ||| <s> Vậy còn chiến dịch Mùa xuân Ả Rập và những điều đã xảy ra tại Ai Cập thì sao ? </s>
<s> Well in Egypt , the <unk> <unk> the headquarters of the Egyptian secret police in April 2011 , and when they were <unk> the building they found lots of papers . </s> ||| <s> Tại Ai Cập , khi những kẻ nổi loạn chiếm đóng trụ sở của đơn vị cảnh sát mật Ai Cập vào tháng <unk> năm 2011 họ đã phát hiện ra rất nhiều tài liệu mật . </s>
<s> Among those papers , was this <unk> entitled &quot; <unk> . &quot; </s> ||| <s> Trong đó , có tập tài liệu được đánh dấu &quot; <unk> &quot; </s>
<s> And within that <unk> were notes from a company based in Germany which had sold the Egyptian government a set of tools for <unk> -- and in very large scale -- all the communication of the citizens of the country . </s> ||| <s> Trong tài liệu này là những ghi chú từ một công ty có trụ sở ở Đức đã bán cho chính phủ Ai Cập rất nhiều công cụ kỹ thuật cao để có thể nghe lén trên một quy mô lớn tất cả những liên lạc và trao đổi của người dân . </s>
<s> They had sold this tool for <unk> Euros to the Egyptian government . </s> ||| <s> Họ đã bán những công cụ này cho chính phủ Ai Cập với giá <unk> <unk> . </s>
<s> The company headquarters are right here . </s> ||| <s> Đây chính là trụ sở chính của công ty đó . </s>
<s> So Western governments are providing <unk> governments with tools to do this against their own citizens . </s> ||| <s> Vậy là những chính phủ phương Tây đang cung cấp cho các chính phủ độc tài những công cụ để chống lại người dân của họ . </s>
<s> But Western governments are doing it to themselves as well . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng chính phủ phương Tây cũng thực hiện điều đó ngay tại quốc gia của mình </s>
<s> For example , in Germany , just a couple of weeks ago the so-called State <unk> was found , which was a <unk> used by German government officials to investigate their own citizens . </s> ||| <s> Ví dụ như ở Đức , vài tuần trước đây người ta đã phát hiện ra <unk> <unk> , là một loại <unk> được nhân viên chính phủ Đức sử dụng để điều tra người dân của họ . </s>
<s> If you are a suspect in a criminal case , well it &apos;s pretty obvious , your phone will be <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Nếu bạn đang bị nghi ngờ có dính <unk> đến một tội ác nào đó , thì điều chắc chắn là điện thoại của bạn đang có &quot; rệp &quot; . </s>
<s> But today , it goes beyond that . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng mọi chuyện không chỉ dừng ở đó . </s>
<s> They will tap your Internet connection . </s> ||| <s> Họ nghe lén đường truyền Internet của bạn . </s>
<s> They will even use tools like State <unk> to infect your computer with a <unk> , which enables them to watch all your communication , to listen to your online discussions , to collect your passwords . </s> ||| <s> Họ thậm chí sẽ sử dụng những công cụ như <unk> <unk> để lây nhiễm vào máy tính của bạn , và từ đó họ có thể có được mọi thông tin bạn trao đổi , có được mọi cuộc hội thoại qua mạng của bạn , và có được mật khẩu của bạn . </s>
<s> Now when we think deeper about things like these , the obvious response from people should be that , &quot; Okay , that sounds bad , but that doesn &apos;t really affect me because I &apos;m a legal citizen . </s> ||| <s> Tuy nhiên sẽ có người khi xem xét vấn đề này sẽ phản ứng như sau &quot; Ok , nghe tệ thật đấy , nhưng nó không ảnh hưởng gì đến tôi vì tôi là một công dân gương mẫu </s>
<s> Why should I worry ? </s> ||| <s> Vậy tại sao tôi phải lo lắng ? </s>
<s> Because I have nothing to hide . &quot; </s> ||| <s> Tôi hoàn toàn không có gì khuất tất phải che dấu . </s>
<s> And this is an argument , which doesn &apos;t make sense . </s> ||| <s> Nhưng lập luận này là không hợp lý . </s>
<s> <unk> is <unk> . </s> ||| <s> Quyền riêng tư phải được đảm bảo . </s>
<s> <unk> is not up for discussion . </s> ||| <s> Quyền riêng tư không cần phải tranh luận . </s>
<s> This is not a question between privacy against security . </s> ||| <s> Đây không phải là vấn đề giữa quyền riêng tư và an ninh của đất nước . </s>
<s> It &apos;s a question of freedom against control . </s> ||| <s> Đây là một vấn đề giữa tự do và sự kiểm soát . </s>
<s> And while we might trust our governments right now , right here in 2011 , any right we give away will be given away for good . </s> ||| <s> Và trong khi chúng ta vẫn tin tưởng vào chính phủ ngay lúc này , ngay tại đây , vào năm 2011 này rằng mọi quyền lợi chúng ta mất đi đều là vì những thứ tốt đẹp hơn . </s>
<s> And do we trust , do we blindly trust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ? </s> ||| <s> Và liệu chúng ta có còn tin tưởng , một cách mù quáng vào bất kỳ chính phủ tương lai nào , một chính phủ mà chúng ta có thể có trong 50 năm tới ? </s>
<s> And these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years . </s> ||| <s> Đó chính là câu hỏi mà chúng ta sẽ phải lo lắng trong 50 năm tiếp theo . </s>
